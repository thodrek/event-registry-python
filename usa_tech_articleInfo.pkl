VCAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to deliver a cargo ship to the International Space Station for NASA.\u000a\u000aThe 208-foot-tall (63-meter-tall) booster, built and launched by privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, bolted off its seaside launch pad at 1:52 a.m., slicing the night sky with a bright plume of light as it headed into orbit.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the Dragon cargo capsule perched on top of the rocket was released to begin a two-day journey to the space station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth.\u000a\u000aThe spaceship is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of equipment, supplies and science experiments, including 20 live mice for medical experiments, a prototype 3-D printer and an instrument to monitor ocean wind speeds.\u000a\u000aThe mission, which was delayed one day by poor weather, is the fourth under the company's 12-flight $1.6 billion NASA contract for cargo delivery services.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010.\u000a\u000a"We are ramping up for that launch rate, and actually even more than that," Hans Koenigsmann, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) vice president of mission assurance, told reporters at a prelaunch news conference.\u000a\u000aThe company has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth nearly $5 billion, on its manifest, said SpaceX spokesman John Taylor.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won a second NASA contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to upgrade and fly its Dragon capsules for astronauts -- and potentially paying tourists as well. A crewed Dragon spaceship is targeted for a debut test flight in 2016.\u000a\u000aNASA also awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop and fly a second space taxi. The price difference is primarily the cost of the launcher.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61 million. Boeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150 million. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, manufactures and sells Atlas 5, which predominantly are used for U.S. military missions.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is gunning for that business as well. A lawsuit is pending in federal court contesting the U.S. Air Force's latest noncompeted award to United Launch Alliance.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 13 times, all successfully.\u000a\u000aDragon is due to reach the space station at 11:04 GMT on Tuesday.

VCompanies were asked for ideas on how rail cars should be obtained for hauling 150-ton casks that are filled with radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThe plans of the latest government is to have an interim test storage site in the year 2021 and to have a long term geologic depository in the year 2048. No one actually knows where the sites would be, but Obama administration is already thinking about the contracts for developing, testing as well as certifying the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aOfficials of U.S Energy Department didn't respond to messages that sought detailed comments. The responsibility of regulating shipments is shared by Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation.\u000a\u000aSenior Scientist at Geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc, James Conca says that it is necessary for doing it. A nuclear waste disposal site has been monitored by him.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, opinions were asked for whether the rail cars should be brought or leased. The cars are expected to last for 30 years and on regular tracks, they would run at standard speeds. Heavy protective casks can be accommodated.\u000a\u000aCars have to be buffered so that a safe distance is maintained between the radioactive cargo and a crew. Fuel is already being sent by U.S military by rail from reactors on navy ships for storage to federal labs. More than 2,300 tons was hauled by the civilian power industry from the year 1979 to the year 2007. Nuclear fuel is very radioactive and hot when removed from reactors.

VWASHINGTON -- The government said Friday it will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business.\u000a\u000aNew proposals by the Food and Drug Administration would make it easier for farmers to meet water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA proposed the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them for four years since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say it has been a challenge to balance the need for tighter food safety standards in the wake of major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe along with the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way" and says the rules are new terrain for the agency.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between using raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without facing further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from the rules.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VOLIVE BRANCH - A clearer direction on American energy policies is needed to protect and grow the nation, a growth that will only come when all types of energy are included in that policy.\u000a\u000aThat was a message of Kevin Doddridge, general manager of the Northcentral Electric Power Association to the monthly luncheon of the Olive Branch Chamber of Commerce at the Whispering Woods Hotel and Conference Center, 11200 Old Goodman Road, on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aNorthcentral hosted the monthly luncheon and Doddridge spoke on the electric cooperative's past year and future plans.\u000a\u000aBut, Doddridge also addressed what he sees as a need for an American energy policy that doesn't restrict one fuel source over another, calling it an issue of national protection as well as energy availability.\u000a\u000a"I think you can link energy policy to national security," Doddridge said. "The less we have to rely on foreign influences for our energy, the less we have to involve ourselves and put ourselves at risk. We need to be self-supporting from an energy standpoint."\u000a\u000aThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants and Doddridge pointed those in attendance to a website, www.TellEPA.com, to express their concerns about the proposals.\u000a\u000aA total of 12 states have sued the EPA to stop the proposed rules aimed at cutting greenhouse gases from existing coal-fired power plants. While Mississippi is not one of those states, Alabama and Kentucky are.\u000a\u000aDoddridge said the U.S. hasn't had a clear energy policy for several years and should move toward an approach that takes advantage of all available sources of energy.\u000a\u000a"We need an 'all of the above' approach to make sure we have an adequate energy generation and infrastructure," Doddridge said. "We also need to make sure we do it in such a manner through diverse fuel and everything to where the price doesn't get out of control."\u000a\u000aTellEPA.com is an advocacy program of America's Electric Cooperatives, an organization based in Arlington, Va.\u000a\u000aNorthcentral is in its 64th year of existence, Doddridge said. with 30,000 accounts in its service. The cooperative is in the bottom 20 percent for rates.\u000a\u000aDoddridge said the cooperative will continue to serve the needs of its customers, who are also owners.\u000a\u000a"Cooperatives are born to satisfy the need of the community," Doddridge said. "We let them buy in and be owners, which we are owned by the consumers we serve and make sure that we try to satisfy their needs, recognize problems and remedy them. It's still about driving the local economy and making it work more efficiently and affordable."\u000a\u000aBob Bakken: sports@desototimestribune.com or call 662-429-6397, Ext. 240.

VWith a backdrop of slowly turning wind turbines, the U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday unveiled a plan to manage conservation and renewable energy production on more than 22 million acres in California as part of a federal and state effort to promote clean energy projects.\u000a\u000aThe Desert Renewable Energy and Conservation Plan has been five years in the making and carves out most of the California desert and inland valleys for large-scale solar, wind and geothermal development. It also identifies areas where conservation will trump energy development.\u000a\u000aThe 8,000-page document is meant to direct development to less environmentally sensitive areas of the state. But the plan also has a loophole that allows companies to apply for a variance to develop at a sensitive site where they wish to place an energy project.\u000a\u000aMany conservation groups object to the variances, arguing that the desert is already sprinkled with badly sited projects pushed through under pressure by developers.\u000a\u000a"They are unwilling to make a courageous decision to say, "No," to horrible projects," said David Lamfrom with the National Parks Conservation Assn.\u000a\u000aFew groups had a chance to read a draft of the plan, which was released Tuesday afternoon. Most environmental organizations cautiously praised it as a good start.\u000a\u000aJewell praised California as a leader in renewable energy, as did U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and other officials who braved blistering heat during a ceremony that took place at a wind farm near Palm Springs.

VDENVER (AP) -- GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a press release touting the turbine ad that first aired on Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000aKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt\u000a\u000aGardner's Next Generation Energy ad: http://bit.ly/1qdgy63

VMeet Sparky! That's the nickname astronomers gave to an incredible discovery in the farthest reaches of space. It's what's called "galaxy construction," a dense collection of millions of rapidly-forming stars.\u000a\u000aIt's so far away from us though that the light we're seeing now took 11 billion years to reach Earth!\u000a\u000aAstronomers say watching this galaxy grow could give us new insight into how stars, galaxies, and our universe formed.\u000a\u000aSLS ROCKET DEVELOPMENT\u000a\u000aNASA is getting closer to launching is next-generation rocket.\u000a\u000aIt's still a few years off, but once the new space launch system (SLS) is complete, it would carry astronauts into orbit and beyond, perhaps even to Mars.\u000a\u000aIt's the first time NASA has done this kind of development since the creation of the space shuttle.\u000a\u000aThey're hoping to launch the first one in November 2018.\u000a\u000aOLDEST MUSCLE TISSUE DISCOVERED\u000a\u000aWednesday, archaeologists announced the discovery of the oldest muscle tissue.\u000a\u000aThe rare fossil was found five years ago in a fossil-rich area off the coast of Newfoundland and dates back 560 million years.\u000a\u000aThey say the creature was similar to modern jellyfish, corals, or anemones, and the bundle of fibers that gave it its shape was muscle tissue.\u000a\u000a"We believe that it is most probably the oldest complex animal in the world and the oldest evidence of muscular tissue in the world. So it's a really important fossil for science and it's really great that it's here in Newfoundland," says Oxford University PhD student Jack Matthews.\u000a\u000aResearchers hope the fossil can be preserved and put on display for people to see.\u000a\u000aResearchers say that fossil pre-dates the Cambrian Explosion, which was a period of rapid development that started about 541 million years ago. The development of muscles, they say, enabled animals to become a dominant force in global ecosystems.

VIt seems that Californians are beginning to catch on to the fact that it's time to cut back on water. According to the State Water Resources Control Board, a 7.5 percent reduction of urban water usage was recorded statewide in July, compared to the same time last year.\u000a\u000aThis news comes after the sate passed a series of mandatory drought restrictionswhich can result in hefty fines for water waters. However, those restrictions weren't in effect until July 29.\u000a\u000aThough we're still not at the governor's goal of a 20 percent reduction, it appears residents may finally be taking note of the severe drought the state is in, and the overall decreasing water supply.\u000a\u000aThe 7.5 percent drop in water usage represents:\u000a\u000a"We are glad to see the progress that many more California urban communities have made to conserve water," said Felicia Marcus, Chair of the State Water Board. "Every action, from taking a shorter shower, to putting a lawn on a water diet, to replacing turf with drought-tolerant landscaping, contributes to every community's water security.\u000a\u000a"While this initial report is an improvement, we hope and trust that it is just a start. Countless Californians see and feel the effects of this drought and know that we still are facing a drought that may be far from over- others still do not and can and should step up. Wasting precious potable water today imperils our communities' future."\u000a\u000aThe State Water Board says that the July water drop represents numbers reported by 87 percent of urban water suppliers, who in turn represent 97 percent of the population served.\u000a\u000a"Some northern California communities facing acute water shortages have dramatically reduced their water consumption by as much as 40-50 percent," the water board reported.\u000a\u000aAs for SoCal, conservation efforts have been "aggressive," according to the water board.\u000a\u000a"Approximately 2.5 million square feet of turf was removed from residential properties in Southern California in July (1665 front yards), while an additional 4.7 million square feet of turf was removed from commercial properties in Southern California in July (82 football fields)," the agency reports.\u000a\u000aWater usage also fell in June, by 4.4 percent.\u000a\u000aFigures for August, the first full month when water use restrictions were in effect, are expected later this month.

VREDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. (Aug. 22, 2014) -- One of the Army's four-star generals took a very public stand on the agency developing the nation's Ballistic Missile Defense System during the Space and Missile Defense Symposium at the Von Braun Center here, Aug. 13.\u000a\u000aAnd that stand was firmly on the side of making a difference.\u000a\u000aGen. Chuck Jacoby, who serves as commander of U.S. Northern Command, which protects the U.S. and its neighbors Canada and Mexico; as well as being the commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD, expressed his appreciation to the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA.\u000a\u000a"There has been an incredible sea change in our relationship with MDA over the last year," Jacoby said. "They have adopted a culture of support for the warfighter that I find incredible. We are better defended today than a year ago, thanks to MDA and [MDA Director Navy Vice Adm.] Jim Syring."\u000a\u000aSyring spoke about the ballistic missile defense systems in a presentation, just prior to Jacoby's presentation on defending the homeland. Syring took over as director of the Missile Defense Agency in late 2012. About 5,000 of the agency's employees are based in facilities at Redstone Arsenal.\u000a\u000aJacoby has testified extensively to Congress on the importance of missile defense, saying the work MDA does with ballistic missile defense, and the expanding role of the Aerospace Defense Command, provides an "enormous competitive advantage for defending the nation."\u000a\u000aJacoby is the first Army officer to assume command of the Northern Command, which was established 12 years ago. Its traditional role is civil support, but its missions of defending the homeland, and security cooperation are expanding, while the NORAD space mission is evolving.\u000a\u000a"Defending the homeland is becoming a complex and challenging problem in all domains," Jacoby said. "Homeland defense issues are becoming higher and higher on my priorities."\u000a\u000aThe Northern Command and NORAD have complementary missions, operate with a common security environment, and share common values. Northern Command partners with other agencies to conduct homeland defense and civil support operations to defend, protect, and secure the U.S. borders and interior, while NORAD conducts aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in defense of North America.\u000a\u000a"Preventing catastrophic actions against North America and the nation is the number one priority, and that includes everything from tornadoes to nuclear threats," Jacoby said. "The number one task is to defend the homeland in depth, while tightly confined to the continent, from Guatemala to the Arctic."\u000a\u000aWhile the relationship with Canada has always been amiable, and essential to national security, Jacoby said, "our relationship with Mexico has never been better, and has never been more important."\u000a\u000aThe security of these two partner nations means security for the U.S., he said. Both Canada and Mexico are economic and security partners with the U.S.\u000a\u000aJacoby stressed the need to have better cyberspace intelligence in defense of the nation. Currently, he said, it is difficult to know "when malicious activity becomes an attack," both in cyberspace and in space.\u000a\u000a"We need to be able to see across all domains," he said, predicting future attacks would be multi-pronged. "We won't see an attack in just one domain. We will get a complex number of attacks occurring simultaneously."\u000a\u000aAlthough the focus is on protecting and defending the U.S., Jacoby said the defense of the nation doesn't stop at its waterline.\u000a\u000a"There is no other commander more interested in what's going on in North Korea, and in the uncontrolled territories of Syria and Iran," he said. I've got to be connected where networks are concerned (for situational awareness). The area of interest is global, the area of responsibility is confined. And I'm most concerned with the problems with people we've stopped watching.\u000a\u000a"We need better intelligence of North Korea," he continued. "We need to know more about their intentions and capability. We need information on extremist groups and individuals. They can reach our homeland in ways they couldn't in the past."\u000a\u000aNorthern Command relies on its partnerships with 50 governors and their state agencies, and with several federal agencies, to accomplish its mission.\u000a\u000a"The best way to defend the country is the old-fashioned way, with deterrence," he said. "What did the Cold War accomplish? It helped keep the peace. When you think about how to deter threats, missile defense is critical to create some kind of deterrent against the development of weapons of mass destruction. How do you deter terrorist activity?\u000a\u000a"[Terrorism is] a real practical threat to the homeland that we don't have an answer for, [and it] will seriously constrain leader decisions and [it] will take options off the table," he explained.\u000a\u000aGeographic combatant commanders are facing more difficult challenges that can be better addressed with a strong missile defense system, he said. Nations that "demonstrate capabilities and hostilities against the U.S. are seen as a practical threat," and the U.S. must have the defense systems in place to counterbalance that threat, he added.\u000a\u000aBetter intelligence, discretion, sensor resilience and reliability will make the nation stronger when facing world threats, Jacoby said, so it's important to "continue to improve what we've got and look to the future to evolving threats to ensure we outpace them."\u000a\u000aThe bottom line, he said, comes down to providing the American people with a kind of national defense that will keep them safe and secure.\u000a\u000a"I think the American people have high expectations of how this country is defended. They expect that no more airplanes will crash into buildings. They expect us to knock down missiles headed for the U.S.," Jacoby said.\u000a\u000aHe said he is concerned that inadequate budgets will make it virtually impossible to make a strategic decision, and they are unacceptable in a time of great uncertainty worldwide. There are still eight more years of "blind $52 billion cuts a year" to the Department of Defense budget, and Jacoby said, such a budgetary approach "places the country's security at risk."

VWork has begun on a US power station that will capture solar energy with panels spread across 10 square kilometres of federal land south of Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aConstruction has begun on a $US1 billion ($A1.08 billion) solar power generating station in the Mojave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles (10 square kilometres) of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $US1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement that since 2009 the Bureau of Land Management has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 50-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aSilver State North, owned by Canada-based Enbridge Inc., was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will be owned by a subsidiary of NextEra, and will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VATLANTA -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food (CFSAF) today applauded Representative Glenn Thompson (R-PA-05) for cosponsoring the bipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which will establish national labeling standards for food and beverage products and eliminate the potential confusion and bureaucratic, costly red tape stemming from a 50-state patchwork of laws and regulations that could raise the cost of food.\u000a\u000a"In sponsoring The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, Representative Thompson is taking an important stand on behalf of consumers, food safety and science," said Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food. "American families deserve access to safe and affordable food, and this legislation will ensure that important food safety and labeling decisions are made by scientists, not political activists."\u000a\u000aThe Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act would prevent duplicative labeling, increased transportation costs, unnecessary product warehousing, burdensome product segregation plans and highly inefficient transportation requirements. A state-by-state patchwork of labeling laws would not advance food safety, inform consumers, or provide consistency in labeling.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the legislation reaffirms the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as America's sole authority on food safety and labeling requirements; requires the FDA to approve all new GMO ingredients before they are brought to market; sets a federal standard for the labeling definition of "natural;" and establishes federal standards for companies that wish to voluntarily label their products for the absence-of or presence-of GMO food ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe most influential food safety regulatory agencies and organizations around the world, including the FDA, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that GMOs are as safe as any other foods. In addition, studies have shown that unnecessary GMO labeling would increase costs for the average family by approximately $400 per year.\u000a\u000aThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is a broad-based coalition representing the entire American agriculture food chain - from farm to fork. CFSAF is committed to increasing understanding about the science and safety of GM technology and to advocating for a federal labeling solution.

VPORTLAND -- In a TV ad paid for by advocates of labeling genetically modified foods in Oregon, voters are told 64 countries have such requirements and labels didn't lead to an increase in their food costs.\u000a\u000aOpponents of GMO labeling have released an ad that says the opposite: Labels would be costly for food producers and consumers and would not show which ingredients in a product are modified.\u000a\u000aWith a decision on the Nov. 4 ballot measure just five weeks away, the two opposing camps combined have reported contributions of nearly $3 million and expenditures of more than $2 million, including advertising. It's a sign of what's still to come.\u000a\u000aThis is round three in the GMO labeling match in recent years. Similar measures in California and in Washington state failed narrowly after millions of dollars were spent, mostly by labeling opponents.\u000a\u000a(For more on this fall's campaigns, see www.oregonlive.com/elections)\u000a\u000aIf adopted, the initiative by Oregon GMO Right to Know would require manufacturers, retailers and suppliers to label raw and packaged foods produced entirely or partially by genetic engineering. The measure would not apply to animal feed or food served in restaurants. It would be effective January 2016.\u000a\u000aThe Unites States does not require labeling of genetically engineered foods. Three states -- Vermont, Maine and Connecticut -- have passed labeling laws, although they don't take effect immediately. A similar measure also recently qualified for the ballot in Colorado.\u000a\u000aLabeling supporters say there aren't enough studies on the impacts of GMOs, so consumers have a right to know if they are eating them. Gov. John Kitzhaber, who is running for re-election, recently came out in support of the measure, as did Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.\u000a\u000aCritics say mandatory labels would mislead consumers into thinking that engineered ingredients are unsafe, which scientists have not proven. As in previous cases, the anti-labeling campaign is chiefly financed by out-of-state food corporations and biotech companies that grow engineered crops; endorsers include large state farming groups.\u000a\u000aThough it's not reflected in the early filings, opponents are expected to raise a lot more money than proponents.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling campaign in Oregon has thus far reported just over $1 million in cash and in-kind contributions and has reported spending about half a million, according to filings with the Oregon Secretary of State's office.\u000a\u000aThe pro-labeling campaign shows $1.9 million in contributions and expenditures of $1.6 million.\u000a\u000aThese donations and expenditures are from a month ago because the campaigns have 30 days to make reports.\u000a\u000aIn both California and Washington state, biotech and other giant food companies vastly outspent opponents -- a factor most experts agree helped defeat those measures. In both cases, the measures were defeated by about 2 percentage points.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling campaign spent about $45.6 million in California, compared to $8.7 million by labeling supporters. In Washington state, where the ballot contest went on record as the costliest in state history, opponents spent $33.3 million, compared to $9.8 million collected by the pro-labeling groups.\u000a\u000aIn Oregon, the labeling issue isn't new. In 2002, voters soundly defeated a GMO labeling measure. But the attention to GMO's has grown since then, as has opposition to genetically engineered crops in Oregon.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, voters in two rural, conservative counties in southern Oregon -- Jackson and Josephine -- approved bans on GMO crops. The vote came on the heels of the discovery of a patch of GMO wheat in Eastern Oregon. That discovery led to Japan and South Korea suspending imports of the crop over GMO concerns, temporarily closing a $700 million market and causing outcry and concern among farmers.\u000a\u000aLabeling proponents say that could help turn the tide in Oregon. Ads released by both sides feature Oregon farmers, a tell-tale sign of their importance to the measure's fate.\u000a\u000aSupporters say labels would help family farmers by "letting people know the difference between the traditional food we grow and food genetically engineered in a lab." Opponents say labels would hurt farmers, because "the last thing we need is a bunch of complex, costly regulations that don't exist in any other states."\u000a\u000aLabeling proponents also say they've learned from pro-labeling campaigns in California and Washington.\u000a\u000a"We've tightened the language in Measure 92 so the opposition can't make the same misleading claims they did in both those states," including making clear that labeling applies only to food meant for human consumption and increasing protections for farmers, campaign spokesman Kevin Glenn said.\u000a\u000aThe campaign is also focusing more on knocking on doors and registering new voters, Glenn said. The approach seems to be working: The coalition has received donations from nearly 3,000 Oregon donors. Its extensive list of endorsements includes nearly 100 farms and farming organizations, as well as dozens of restaurants, grocers, chefs and other groups.\u000a\u000aOpponents call the measure badly written. It would not, for example, require labels for meat and dairy products from animals fed genetically engineered feed. They also say consumers who wish to avoid GMOs already have the choice to buy organic foods.\u000a\u000a"This measure provides inaccurate and misleading information, and doesn't tell consumers what's in the food," said Dana Bieber, spokeswoman for the Vote NO on 92 Coalition.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling side has not released a full list of endorsers.

VDENVER (AP) -- GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a press release touting the turbine ad that first aired on Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

VFour companies said today that they have proposed a new, $8 billion initiative which will provide a huge amount of clean electricity to the Los Angeles area, which combines the creation, of one of America's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage facility, and a 525-mile, transmission line, to help power an estimated 1.2 million LA area homes. The initiative--being proposed by Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, ZDresser Rand, and Duke-American Transmission--would be the largest, clean energy project in the United States. According to the companies, the project would provide 9.2 million megawatt-hours -- more than twice the Hoover Dam, and would use a wind farm in Wyoming to generate 2,100 megawatts of electricity, with a compressed air energy storage facility built in a underground salt formation near Delta, Utah, with energy storage capacity of 60,000 megawatt-hours of electricity. All of that would be connected with a $2.6 billion, 525 mile electric line to move all that electricity between Wyoming and Utah. The four companies have not where they expect to get the $8 billion needed to build the proposed project.

VWith towering white wind turbines turning slowly in the background, U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday unveiled a plan to manage both conservation and renewable energy production on more than 22 million acres in California -- nearly one-quarter of the state -- as part of a federal and state effort to promote clean energy production.\u000a\u000aThe Desert Renewable Energy and Conservation Plan, which Jewell called unprecedented, has been five years in the making. It carves out most of the Southern California desert and inland valleys for large-scale solar, wind and geothermal development and identifies reserve areas where protecting the land and animals that inhabit it will trump energy development.\u000a\u000aFew environmental groups had read the 8,000-page document, which is still in draft form, before its release, and many praised it as a good start. Others, though, said they worried that the plan provided too much leeway for developers to continue projects in environmentally sensitive areas.\u000a\u000a"We are ready for an end to the way projects have been approved for siting," said Barbara Boyle of the Sierra Club. "If the goal is reducing conflict, they are going to see a lot of agitation in the desert."\u000a\u000aThe plan aims to bring order to a region that has become a green-power battleground, pitting developers against environmental advocates in a dispute over the future of the Mojave Desert. The goal is to create consistency not only for environmental regulations -- protecting species such as the desert tortoise, along with tribal lands and public recreation areas -- but also for transmitting green energy.\u000a\u000aJewell and other officials praised California as a leader in renewable energy. Since President Obama announced in his first term a federal commitment to expedite green energy development, there has been a rush to build renewable energy power plants here. What were typically long, complicated environmental reviews for such projects were rushed through. It triggered a flood of interest from the industry, but the Interior's Bureau of Land Management did not provide guidance for managing utility-scale projects on federal land. The department has approved 52 renewable energy projects since 2009, eclipsing decades of slow growth.\u000a\u000aThe draft plan outlines an approach that directs development to less sensitive areas of the state, in part by offering incentives for developers to choose sites that are preapproved by the agency, allowing expedited permitting and little or no new environmental analysis, which would have already been performed by federal scientists.\u000a\u000aThe plan also includes a controversial variance system that has been in place. It allows developers that want to build outside approved areas to do so by applying for a variance, but doing so would be slower and more costly.\u000a\u000a"They are unwilling to make a courageous decision to say no to horrible projects," said David Lamfrom with the National Parks Conservation Assn.\u000a\u000aThere is only one project currently in a variance area. The proposed Silurian Valley solar and wind facility near Death Valley National Park is in one of the protected areas of the plan. The project is highly contentious in the local community, where opponents say it jeopardizes their unmolested views and the region's wildlife. The National Park Service and state and federal fish and wildlife agencies have expressed grave concerns about the proposal.\u000a\u000aBecause it is already in the permitting process, though, the Silurian project and many others will not be governed by the new plan's framework.\u000a\u000aIn the name of combating climate change, many groups have defended renewable projects that they would typically oppose because of their negative environmental effects. They may take a tougher position in the future. The plan, they say, gives them a vehicle to launch legal challenges to such projects. Because it will be in place for the next 25 years, they hope to ensure that it conserves the most vulnerable places.\u000a\u000a"This is the template, this sets the tone," said Kim Delfino of Defenders of Wildlife. "We have to get this straight now, so that it's clear going forward."\u000a\u000aJewell acknowledged that the plan would have detractors, but said everyone would have the chance to weigh in before it is finalized next year.

VSAN FRANCISCO -- Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday unveiled a proposed roadmap for developing massive solar and wind projects in California's Mojave Desert while trying to minimize damage to desert habitat and animals.\u000a\u000aThe plan -- covering 22 million acres of public and private land -- follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's Mojave desert during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers siting sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday would designate a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted. Jewell's release Tuesday opened the plan for several months of public comment.\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Conservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species. The plant also proved unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be. "There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat. "The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VLast weekend, a Russian tourist decided to climb the Brooklyn Bridge all the way up to the tower on the Brooklyn side, literally just because he thought it would be "fun." So as penance, Judge ShawnDya Simpson literally wants him to clean the Brooklyn Bridge, which we're sure would be tons of fun.\u000a\u000aAnd the judge was actually doing him a favor in suggesting it: the district attorney's office wanted to give Russian tourist Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, a 90-day jail sentence for taking selfies while climbing the Bridge. But Simpson thinks that's a bit too harsh, and instead wants him to perform "a bunch of community service."\u000a\u000a"If he likes the bridge, then let him clean the bridge," Simpson said in Brooklyn Criminal Court Friday. "I'm not condoning his behavior. Was it the smartest thing to do? No. Was it malicious? I don't think so, so I think you need to work it out."\u000a\u000aThe police response to Kolchin, who was charged with reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct for the incident, cost taxpayers $7,407, which included the use of a helicopter and two boats.\u000a\u000aSadly, sources tell the Post that it's unlikely that Simpson's decree will come to pass, since there's no program set up for cleaning the Bridge.

VAtlanta - The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."

VCAPE CANAVERAL Fla (Reuters) - An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to deliver a cargo ship to the International Space Station for NASA.\u000a\u000aThe 208-foot (63-meter) tall booster, built and launched by privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, bolted off its seaside launch pad at 1:52 a.m. EDT/0552 GMT, slicing the night-time sky with a bright plume of light as it headed into orbit.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the Dragon cargo capsule perched on top of the rocket was released to begin a two-day journey to the space station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth.\u000a\u000aThe spaceship is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of equipment, supplies and science experiments, including 20 live mice for medical experiments, a prototype 3-D printer and an instrument to monitor ocean wind speeds.\u000a\u000aThe mission, which was delayed one day by poor weather, is the fourth under the company's 12-flight $1.6 billion NASA contract for cargo delivery services.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010.\u000a\u000a"We are ramping up for that launch rate, and actually even more than that," Hans Koenigsmann, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) vice president of mission assurance, told reporters at a prelaunch news conference.\u000a\u000aThe company has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth nearly $5 billion, on its manifest, said SpaceX spokesman John Taylor.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won a second NASA contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to upgrade and fly its Dragon capsules for astronauts - and potentially paying tourists as well. A crewed Dragon spaceship is targeted for a debut test flight in 2016.\u000a\u000aNASA also awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop and fly a second space taxi. The price difference is primarily the cost of the launcher. [ID:nL1N0RI2XY]\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61 million. Boeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150 million. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, manufactures and sells Atlas 5, which predominantly are used for U.S. military missions.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is gunning for that business as well. A lawsuit is pending in federal court contesting the U.S. Air Force's latest non-competed award to United Launch Alliance.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 13 times, all successfully.\u000a\u000aDragon is due to reach the space station at 7:04 a.m. EDT/1104 GMT on Tuesday.

VThe promoting of renewable energy is at the heart of the current debate on energy policy. From an economic perspective, the question focusses on determining the cost of the feed-in tariff systems. Firstly, whether the incentives are as expensive as has been maintained in the most recent regulatory modifications, and secondly, whether the effect is similar with respect to all renewable technologies. The study by the UPV/EHU's Bilbao Energy Research Team (BERT) tackles these questions empirically, and concludes that wind energy continues to produce greater savings than what its incentives amount to, while photovoltaic solar technologies are still in the development phase. The study has been published in the journal Energy Policy.\u000a\u000aThe UPV/EHU study analyses the electricity market in Spain during the 2008-2012 period -a time of maximum renewable penetration in Spain when energy production within the Special Scheme saw a 57% increase- and quantifies its cost.\u000a\u000aTo do this, they firstly measured the market savings produced by participating in renewable sources, and secondly, they calculated the amount paid in the form of incentives to green energy. The difference between the two figures represents the net cost of renewable energy. In contrast to other studies published until now, "in this work the separate results for renewable technology are presented for the first time, demonstrating that the general conclusions cannot be applied to all the technologies across the board," pointed out Cristina Pizarro-Irizar, the lead author of the research.\u000a\u000aAs regards the most significant results obtained, they stress that in the initial stages (2008-2009), when the installed renewable capacity was much lower, the savings that renewable generation as a whole produced on the electricity market exceeded the costs of the system. "It signified savings of between 25 and 45 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), depending on the year," stresses Pizarro-Irizar.\u000a\u000aHowever, from 2010 onwards when renewable generation began to grow exponentially, the regulatory costs rose excessively, imposing a positive net cost on the system. "The penetration of renewable energy starts to be so high that the market prices do not fall any further and yet the costs of the incentives do in fact rise. There is a turning point and it is at that precise moment that the system is no longer sustainable. On the Spanish electricity market, that turning point was reached in 2010," explained Cristina Pizarro-Irizar.\u000a\u000aSeparate analysis of the different sources\u000a\u000aIn any case, when analysing the various renewable sources separately, they saw that there are substantial differences between them. This is due "firstly to the market penetration of each of the technologies and, secondly, to the difference in incentives between technologies," stressed Pizarro-Irizar.\u000a\u000aSo "today, wind energy continues to produce greater savings than what its incentives amount to, while photovoltaic solar technologies have not yet managed to secure a big enough participation on the electricity market to be profitable, as they are still in their development phase," she pointed out. In other words, "the market costs would be higher if there was no wind energy, but that would not happen with solar technologies, which have traditionally received higher feed-in tariffs," pointed out Pizarro-Irizar.\u000a\u000aCristina Pizarro-Irizar concludes that "the results of this research point to the importance of designing the incentive systems correctly and the risk of oversizing the feed-in tariff for some technologies".\u000a\u000aIt should be pointed out that Pizarro-Irizar does not view the future as very promising for renewable energy, because owing to the lack of grants, among other things, no new renewable capacity is being installed in Spain. "All this will affect us, from the environmental point of view -since we will go on generating energy using technologies that emit carbon dioxide- and also economically -due to the use of technologies that use gas, which has to be imported-," pointed out Pizarro-Irizar.\u000a\u000aMore information: A. Ciarreta, M. P. Espinosa, C. Pizarro-Irizar. "Is green energy expensive? Empirical evidence from the Spanish electricity market".

VRICHMOND, Indiana -- A utility says its latest solar farm in eastern Indiana has begun generating electricity.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal Power Agency says the eight-acre solar farm on the grounds of Richmond Power and Light contains approximately 4,000 solar panels. They will generate one megawatt of electricity at peak capacity, or enough electricity to power about 200 homes.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal says the solar farm utilizes a horizontal tracking system for the panels that enables them to move, tracking the sun throughout the day. It says construction began earlier this year and was completed this month. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Friday.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal also operates solar farms in Rensselaer and Frankton. The not-for-profit wholesale power provider serves 59 Indiana communities.

VWASHINGTON -- The government will rewrite sweeping new food-safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food-safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food-safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food-safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules.

VCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick\u000a\u000aCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VATLANTA -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

V"The worst part of the raking my yard is having to bag the leaves up," said an inventor from Staten Island, N.Y. "It is too much trouble trying to hold the bag open with one hand while I place leaves inside with the other. That is why I invented this bag holder."\u000a\u000aHe developed the patented EZ LIFT BAG HOLDER to hold a plastic bag open in an upright position. This allows the bag to be filled with leaves, grass clippings and other yard debris quickly and easily.\u000a\u000aThe unit saves individuals the struggle of lifting heavy yard waste, bags breaking and the time required with conventional trash-can liners. It also eliminates hassles and frustrations. The accessory ends the need to hold the bag open with one hand while loading it with the other. Additionally, it makes it easier to perform yard-care duties.\u000a\u000aThis one-piece unit would consist of a ring mounted on the top of three telescopic legs. An open plastic bag would be placed within this unit, and the mouth of the bag would be secured to the ring with clips. Once the bag had been filled, the framework could be pulled away. There would be no need to lift the heavy bag.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the New Jersey office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

VOn the morning of Saturday September 20, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket sat vertical on the Launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Atop the rocket, the Dragon Spacecraft was set, awaiting its CRS-4 supply mission to the International Space Station. Inclement weather crept in and the launch had to be rescheduled for Sunday at 1:52am EDT\u000a\u000aNASA commented on the incident: "Because of weather conditions that violated the rules for launching, SpaceX has postponed its planned launch of its Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft. It is SpaceX's fourth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station."\u000a\u000aAboard the Dragon Spacecraft is nearly 2.5 tons of cargo. Included in this cargo is 1,380 pounds of crew supplied astronauts aboard the International Space Station need to continue their experiments. Also aboard the spacecraft, other experiments and new technology demonstrates to conduct even more research; as well as the International Space Station Rapid Scatteromoter (ISS-RapedScat). This device will be mounted on the exterior of the International Space Station to bounce microwaves off of the ocean's surface in order to measure wind speed.\u000a\u000aOther parts of the Dragon cargo will help to develop a multifaceted study of Factors Contributing to Food Acceptability and Consumption, Mood and Stress on Long-Term Space Missions (or Astro Palate). This study will help NASA better understand how dietary habits can affect space travel, in effect, to help them reduce physical stress during longer missions.\u000a\u000aAlso aboard the spacecraft is the NanoRacks-Ames Fruit-Fly Experiment which aims to study how space flight influences oxidative stress, the accumulation of harmful material from stress which can eventually lead to disease in the body.\u000a\u000aFinally, Made In Space Inc. has also sent a 3D printer for a Zero-G experiment to see if we can use it in space to more immediately deliver certain goods to the space station.

VCape Canaveral - An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to deliver a cargo ship to the International Space Station for Nasa.\u000a\u000aThe 208-foot (63-meter) tall booster, built and launched by privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, bolted off its seaside launch pad at 1:52am EDT/0552 GMT, slicing the night-time sky with a bright plume of light as it headed into orbit.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the Dragon cargo capsule perched on top of the rocket was released to begin a two-day journey to the space station, a $100-billion research complex that flies about 260 miles (420km) above Earth.\u000a\u000aThe spaceship is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2 268kg) of equipment, supplies and science experiments, including 20 live mice for medical experiments, a prototype 3D printer and an instrument to monitor ocean wind speeds.\u000a\u000aThe mission, which was delayed one day by poor weather, is the fourth under the company's 12-flight $1.6-billion Nasa contract for cargo delivery services.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010.\u000a\u000a"We are ramping up for that launch rate, and actually even more than that," Hans Koenigsmann, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) vice president of mission assurance, told reporters at a prelaunch news conference.\u000a\u000aThe company has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth nearly $5-billion, on its manifest, said SpaceX spokesman John Taylor.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won a second Nasa contract, worth up to $2.6-billion, to upgrade and fly its Dragon capsules for astronauts - and potentially paying tourists as well. A crewed Dragon spaceship is targeted for a debut test flight in 2016.\u000a\u000aNasa also awarded Boeing a $4.2-billion contract to develop and fly a second space taxi. The price difference is primarily the cost of the launcher.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61-million. Boeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150-million. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, manufactures and sells Atlas 5, which predominantly are used for US military missions.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is gunning for that business as well. A lawsuit is pending in federal court contesting the US Air Force's latest non-competed award to United Launch Alliance.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 13 times, all successfully.\u000a\u000aDragon is due to reach the space station at 7:04am EDT/1104 GMT on Tuesday. - Reuters

VWe are ready for the final Mars Orbiter Insertion: Isro Chairman\u000a\u000aScientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in Bangalore are preparing for a series of actions as the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) will reach a crucial stage on September 24. According to a top Isro official, it will be known on this day whether the mission was successful.\u000a\u000aK Radhakrishnan, chairman, Isro, looked calm and confident. "If we get nervous or tense, we tend to make mistake. Besides, we are confident that this mission will succeed. If there is any contingency, then we have a Plan B."\u000a\u000aThe real challenge is to restart the engine, which is in idle state for around 300 days, says Radhakrishnan. After performing Trans-Martian Insertion Burn on November 30, 2013, the engine has been kept idle. This is the longest interval for an engine, which is usually employed on geostationary satellites. According to Radhakrishnan, in Chandrayaan-I, the engine was remained idle only for two weeks.\u000a\u000aThe Isro chief said of the 51 missions to Mars globally so far, eight or nine had faced issues at the insertion stage.\u000a\u000a"We also have a Plan-B, which is using the small eight 22 N thrusters for attitude control or orientation, which will not give you this original target. It will be salvaging of the mission," he said.\u000a\u000aIf the engine will not be able to achieve its target during this test, scientists will have enough time to plan and use the eight smaller thrusters to inject 'Mangalyaan' into the Mars orbit, which, however, might not be the intended 372 km x 80,000 km orbit.\u000a\u000aReaching the orbit has been one of the biggest technological challenges for advanced space powers, and India would become the first country to achieve this in the first attempt and also the first Asian country to attain technological capability if it succeeds on September 24.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, the cost this mission is around $70 million (about Rs 426 crore), which is not even one-third of other missions and even less than the production cost of the movie, Gravity, which was around $100 million (about Rs 608 crore).\u000a\u000aEvents to follow\u000a\u000aSeptember 24: At 6.57 am, Final phase of operation will start. Reorientation of the spacecraft should commence and it has to stabilise.\u000a\u000aAt 7.15 am: Liquid engine firing would start and in the nominal operation that should be for about 24 seconds. Then once the desired velocity is achieved, the computer will give the command to cut the firing based on the accelerometer, which is onboard the spacecraft.\u000a\u000aSignal will take 12.5 minutes to reach here. That means Isro will know only after 12.5 minutes what is happening at the space.\u000a\u000aAt 8.15 am, Isro could confirm whether the operation is successful.\u000a\u000aLater on the day: Colour camera will also be operated on the same date.

VHawaiian Electric Co.'s responses to Hawaii regulators regarding the future of the state's energy industry won't be revealed to the public until Wednesday morning, but experts, such as Fereidun Fesharaki, are predicting that the Honolulu-based utility won't propose anything dramatic.\u000a\u000aFesharaki, along with his son, Shasha, both internationally-known energy experts and the chairman and chief operating officer, respectively, for Honolulu-based Facts Global Energy, addressed the current energy scene in Hawaii on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"The [Hawaii Public Utilities Commission] has ordered [HECO] to make changes, and it's some tall orders," Ferediun said. "[HECO] will come up with some lofty goals, that are good for the future, but nobody's there to keep them accountable down the road."\u000a\u000aHawaiian Electric, through its spokesman, told PBN on Tuesday that its responses to the PUC orders, which were handed down in late April, will be available for the public to see Wednesday morning.\u000a\u000a"Our energy environment is changing rapidly and we are changing with it to meet our customers' evolving energy needs," spokesman Darren Pai said. "We've developed plans that outline specific actions for adding significantly more renewable energy and lowering costs for our customers. We look forward to filing these plans with the Public Utilities Commission and sharing them."\u000a\u000aThe reports are in response to the PUC's rejection of the utilities' plan, and order to come up with new directives which outline the vision, strategies and regulatory policy changes required to align the utilities' business models with customers' changing expectations and state energy policy.\u000a\u000aDuane Shimogawa covers energy, real estate and economic development for Pacific Business News.

VATLANTA -- Federal officials are looking for train cars to haul nuclear waste toward its final resting place.\u000a\u000aToo bad they have no idea where that train will actually go.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the U.S. Department of Energy asked commercial firms this spring for ideas on buying or leasing specialized train cars to haul radioactive, used fuel from nuclear reactors to an interim storage site or a geologic depository. Those railcars will carry 150-ton casks of fuel up to eight times annually.\u000a\u000aU.S. officials began charging electricity customers years ago for handling the disposal of nuclear power waste. Plans for a disposal site have repeatedly bogged down.\u000a\u000aThe waste will likely move by rail because it's too heavy for trucks or even normal railcars.\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VExtreme weather events -- the sort likely to arise with increasing frequency as the planet warms -- took a heavy toll on Russia and East Africa in 2010 and 2011, in large part because governments and authorities were ill-equipped to address resulting food shortages and other fallout, according to researchers at the University of Oxford. Russia experienced a heat wave that led to food hoarding and price-fixing of staple crops by speculators, according to the report, which was commissioned by Oxfam. A drought in East Africa in 2010 through 2011 was tied to an uptick in armed conflicts in the region, which interrupted international and domestic aid for six months. Crop prices reached record levels in several markets, including wheat in Ethiopia, maize in Kenya, and red sorghum grain in Somalia, the report notes. Investing in additional health facilities, establishing pre-positioned food supplies, and other tactics aimed at mitigating the effects of future heat waves, droughts, and floods, could help to blunt the effects of climate change on the poorest and most vulnerable populations, the researchers say.

VWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VBruno Mars.\u000a\u000aA few years ago, if someone asked you if you knew Bruno Mars, you might have thought that they were absolutely crazy. You might have thought that they were pulling your leg, making up comical names to make you laugh.\u000a\u000aHowever, it seems as if the name "Bruno Mars" is becoming more and more popular in different parts of the world with each passing day.\u000a\u000aHe sings. He dances. He acts. He plays the guitar and the piano beautifully. Is there anything that Bruno Mars can't do?\u000a\u000aFrom his recent track record, it seems as if the one thing that Bruno Mars can't do is release an album that doesn't reach the US Billboard charts.\u000a\u000aWhile it is true that Bruno Mars has only released two studio albums, Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010) and Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), both of those albums have been able to achieve success on a commercial level as well as with some of the toughest critics in the industry.\u000a\u000aYou probably have already read the reports that Bruno Mars has already started working on his third studio album. It seems if he is overdue for one - especially since Bruno Mars' first two albums came two years apart.\u000a\u000aHowever, since the release of Unorthodox Jukebox, Bruno has definitely been busy -- acting (Rio 2, hosting Saturday Night Live), being chosen to perform during the Super Bowl halftime show alongside the Red Hot Chili Peppers as well as having a successful tour (Moonshine Jungle Tour).\u000a\u000aHowever, even though he has not spend very much time in the studio, you should still get excited now over Bruno Mars' third studio album instead of waiting for it to come out.\u000a\u000aWhy?\u000a\u000a1. His track record speaks for itself. His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, was certified double-platinum with over 2.3 million units sold. If you think that is impressive, the fact that Unorthodox Jukebox has sold over 6 million copies around the world since being released should blow you away!\u000a\u000a2. Bruno Mars is an impressive songwriter. Unlike many other performers and singers today, Bruno Mars does not depend on ghostwriters and other producers to come up with great songs for him. Bruno Mars writes his own songs. Keep in mind that he is the lyrical mastermind behind such hits as "Forget You" by Cee-Lo Green, so he has already proven that he can write hits well for himself and other people. There really is no reason to believe that anything would change on his third album - especially since he has already proven his skills on the first two.\u000a\u000a3. Bruno Mars brings something brand new to the table. Within the world of R&B and pop music today, it is very hard to find someone with a unique sound and/or take on their music. Think about all of the songs that basically sound the same - even though they are recorded and released by different people. Bruno Mars has been able to stay ahead of the pact by sticking to his own flavor of music that just so happens to taste good to everyone else.\u000a\u000aYou might decide to deny Bruno Mars the respect he deserves - waiting for his new album to come out before you get excited. Or, you can pay close attention to the fact that Bruno has already proven himself and get excited about what he is going to do now.\u000a\u000aThe choice is yours.\u000a\u000a[Image Credit: Music 4]

VPittsburgh-based InventHelp is attempting to submit the Paver Lifter to appropriate companies for their consideration and possible feedback.\u000a\u000a"I've used the paver-lifting tools that are already on the market, and they're not only bulky, but they can damage the pavers," said an inventor and irrigation technician from New York, N.Y. "This inspired me to design a better tool for this important task."\u000a\u000aTo meet this need, he created a prototype of the PAVER LIFTER, which provides an easier way to lift pavers. This streamlines the installation of pipe, wires and/or conduit and eliminates need to carry and transport cumbersome, heavy tools. It also helps prevent damaged pavers, as well as saves time and effort.

VJay Orfield, Environmental Innovation Fellow, New York\u000a\u000aWhile this may have been a tough week for some of New York's school kids, who, in the last few days, have headed back to class, the school districts that educate them, just got some great news:\u000a\u000aA new, New York State program called K-Solar (read that: "K through Solar") has just launched. It builds on the fact that school districts across the country are using solar power to reduce their second-biggest expense -- energy costs - and to excite kids about science and math, and to teach them the increasingly vital skill of environmental stewardship.\u000a\u000aK-Solar is offering the state's 695 public school districts free, no-obligation site assessments to determine whether their roofs, parking lots and unused fields are good spots for solar power. (With K-Solar, there's no need to consult a private engineering or architecture firm.) The program will help districts figure out whether solar is right for them, and more. If a district decides to go ahead with a solar project -- schools can withdraw from the process at any time -- K-Solar will walk the district through the solar development process and will offer the district enrollment in a collective purchasing plan that can save school districts 10-20 percent on the cost of solar power systems. (Most of these solar systems will come about through power-purchase agreements in which a third-party developer builds and owns the system and sells electricity back to the school at a discounted rate.)\u000a\u000aAlready, 40 districts across the state have signed up for the initial assessment and yours can, too, by emailing solar@nypa.gov.\u000a\u000aIn an age when nearly every school district is cash-strapped and teachers are looking for new ways to engage kids in the high-employment fields of science, technology, engineering and math, solar is the answer many educators have been looking for. (Parents and other taxpayers like it, too, by the way.)\u000a\u000aK-Solar has come about thanks to the NY-Sun Initiative, the Empire State's plan to incentivize solar power here in New York; it was extended this year to catalyze a full 3 gigawatts of solar power by 2023. The free assessments are provided by the New York Power Authority, the state's public power provider. The New York State Education Department is in on the action, too.\u000a\u000aAll of this means that schools from Plattsburgh to Shelter Island, West Seneca to Glens Falls can have experts fill them in on whether they can benefit from the low electric prices, great teaching and learning opportunities, and world-saving environmental benefits that solar power provides, all at everyone's favorite price: free.\u000a\u000aThat might not bring a smile this week to the faces of New York's school kids, as their summers come to a close -- at least not yet. (As the panels start getting installed, watch for things to change.) But for school districts and the communities that support them, K-Solar is a sunny day.

VChevron site manager Greg Murphy is pictured at a recent media event. Chevron this week confirmed the sale of its renewable energy arm to OpTerra Energy Services. Reuters/Bogdan Cristel\u000a\u000aChevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has finalized the sale of its renewable energy subsidiary, making it the latest global oil company to abandon its foray into cleaner technologies. Chevron Energy Solutions was sold to California-based OpTerra Energy Services for an undisclosed amount last Friday, a Chevron spokesman confirmed to Bloomberg News this week.\u000a\u000aChevron, which acquired the subsidiary from PG&E Energy Services in 2000, said the group had developed hundreds of renewable and energy-efficiency projects that were "reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons," Bloomberg noted.\u000a\u000aThe company said in a statement that the sale "is part of an internal strategic focus on supporting Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses." Earlier this year, Chevron sold its 48-person business unit that develops renewable power plants and energy-savings projects for U.S. federal agencies. The oil giant also pulled back funding for biofuel projects last year.\u000a\u000aRoyal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE:RDS.A) and BP PLC (NYSE:BP) have similarly scaled back investments in renewable biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol produced from woody plants and waste. The two companies stopped funding four projects last year because they said the technology will not be economically viable until 2020 or later, Environmental Leader reported at the time. That brought overall biofuel investments from a high of $7.6 billion in the last quarter of 2007 to a low of $57 million for the first quarter of 2013.\u000a\u000aBP also divested its U.S. wind farm division last year as the company narrowed its focus to high-yield oil and gas projects. The British oil major dumped its solar business in 2011 after four decades in the game, saying the unit had become unprofitable. Shell suspended its wind, solar and hydrogen projects in 2009.\u000a\u000aThe moves away from clean energy are concerning to analysts who warn the fossil fuel companies could be caught off guard if governments take meaningful action to rein in planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, Bloomberg reported in June.\u000a\u000aShare this article Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google + More

VWASHINGTON -- The government will rewrite sweeping new food-safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water-quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules yesterday. The final rules are due next fall.\u000a\u000aRegulators say it has been a challenge to balance the need for tighter food-safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, said the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, too, he said.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination. Food manufacturers also would have to submit food-safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases.\u000a\u000aThe proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThere are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food-safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities.

VNASA cost estimates for operating the International Space Station through 2024 are "overly optimistic," the agency's inspector general reported Thursday, adding that the price of new U.S.-built space taxis likely will be higher than currently projected, exceeding the cost of flying aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft.\u000a\u000aNASA Inspector General Paul Martin also raised questions about NASA's ability to safely operate the lab complex through 2024, the current goal, unless engineers can develop ways to offset age-related solar array degradation; minimize equipment failures and get large replacement components to the lab in the absence of the space shuttle.\u000a\u000a"While the ISS program is actively working to mitigate these risks, anticipating the correct amount of replacement parts and transporting them to the ISS present major challenges to extending station operations 10 or more years beyond its original expected service life," Martin concluded.\u000a\u000aMore troubling, perhaps, the OIG found that the "assumptions underlying the agency's budget projections for the ISS are overly optimistic and that its actual costs may be higher."\u000a\u000aThe report said NASA projects the space station budget will grow from $3 billion a year to nearly $4 billion by fiscal 2020. But the OIG found station costs rose 26 percent between fiscal 2011 and 2013 "and an average of 8 percent annually over the life of the program."\u000a\u000aMuch of the projected cost increase, the report said, was due to higher transportation costs.\u000a\u000a"NASA's estimates for the cost of commercial crew transportation services expected to replace the Russian Soyuz are based on the cost of a Soyuz seat in FY 2016 -- $70.7 million -- per seat for a total cost of $283 million per mission for transporting four astronauts," the report said.\u000a\u000a"However, the program's independent government cost estimates project significantly higher transportation costs when the agency transitions to contracts with commercial spaceflight companies."\u000a\u000aNASA has relied on the three-seat Russian Soyuz to ferry astronauts to and from the space station since even before the shuttle's retirement in 2011. While the cost per seat is significant, it is far less than the cost of a seat on the much more powerful, and more expensive, space shuttle.\u000a\u000aEven so, the lack of a U.S.-built ferry craft has rankled lawmakers and NASA managers alike.\u000a\u000a"You can't really be a serious leader in space if you can't get your people there on your own spaceship," historian John Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said in an interview Wednesday. "The relationship with Russia has been successful, it's cost us less money than doing it on our own. If we were still flying shuttles, we'd be paying a hell of a lot more than the cost of seats on a Soyuz."\u000a\u000aBut commercial U.S. ferry craft represent "both a real and symbolic indication that the United States is one of the leading space countries," he said.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, NASA announced that Boeing and SpaceX would share contracts totaling $6.8 billion to build U.S. crew capsules for flights to low-Earth orbit, carrying four astronauts at a time to the station starting in 2017.\u000a\u000aIt is not yet known how much it will cost to fly astronauts aboard the Boeing CST-100 capsule or SpaceX's Dragon crew ship, but given the cost of the boosters required and the spacecraft themselves, a price tag under $300 million per flight -- comparable to the cost of flying four astronauts on the Soyuz -- appears unlikely.\u000a\u000aBut NASA supporters say comparing costs on a seat-for-seat basis is misleading because the agency will benefit from having additional researchers aboard the space station, NASA will have more flexibility managing crew rotations and the money will go to U.S. aerospace companies and workers, not their Russian counterparts.\u000a\u000aSo far, NASA is the only member of the space station program to formally approve a four-year mission extension to 2024. The European Space Agency, Russia, Canada and Japan have not yet indicated whether they will follow suit.\u000a\u000aThe OIG urged NASA to "continue to solicit commitments from international partners to maintain their support for the ISS and reduce the agency's costs;" to identify and prioritize the medical research needed to facilitate long-duration space exploration before the station's ultimate decommissioning; and to pursue legislation to address patent license and data rights for commercial researchers.\u000a\u000a"Failure to address these challenges in a timely manner could significantly affect the functionality, cost and value of extending the operational life of the Station until 2024," the report said.\u000a\u000aA NASA statement released in response to the inspector general's report said the agency welcomed the report and was responding to its concerns.\u000a\u000aThe Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, the statement said, "continues to solicit commitments from its international partners to improve cost sharing; to track, manage and mitigate human health risks to long-term exploration and identify and prioritize those risks that must be mitigated prior to decommissioning the space station; and to pursue legislative options that will address patent license and data rights."

VDemocrats have seized on an Associated Press story that says GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner talks in a new campaign ad about co-writing a law to launch Colorado's green-energy industry, but omits the fact the law was repealed five years later, "deemed useless for not enabling a single project."\u000a\u000aA liberal group attacking Gardner on every front -- from climate change to gay marriage -- says the Gardner ad makes him an early front-runner its first ever "Golden Manure" award, given to "the candidate whose campaign produces the largest load of fertilizer when it comes to taking action on climate."\u000a\u000a"The Associated Press article articulates exactly what we said when Congressman Gardner first tried to green-wash his record as a Koch brothers crony," said NextGen Climate spokeswoman Abby Leeper. "The claim is, take your pick: A lie, not true, horse pucky, full of hot air, bologna, nonsense, drivel."\u000a\u000aBut what NextGen Climate and other lefties have done is overlook other facts in the AP story by Kristen Wyatt concerning the bill Gardner co-sponsored when he served in the Colorado House. He now is a congressman trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall.\u000a\u000aThe advocacy group was founded by billionaire Tom Steyer, an investor and environmentalist who backs Udall.\u000a\u000aThe 2007 law created the Clean Energy Development Authority, which was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter singled Gardner out in his first State of the State speech, saying the bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut as AP wrote:\u000a\u000aThe authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear why the bill was signed into law if it was fraught with problems.\u000a\u000aThe AP story also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry. "Gardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy," the story says.\u000a\u000aBut critics say the real issue isn't a measure that didn't do anything, but Gardner looking straight into the camera and saying with a straight face that he co-wrote the law that "launched the state's green energy industry."\u000a\u000aThat's because enviros believe the launch came in 2004 when guess who, Mark Udall, teamed up with Republican House Speaker Lola Spradley to successfully push for Amendment 37. It required Colorado's top seven utilities to get a percentage of their retail electricity sales from renewable sources, beginning with 3 percent in 2007 and increasing to 10 percent by 2015. Lawmakers later set the standards higher.\u000a\u000a"In every meaningful way, it was Amendment 37 that 'launched' Colorado's new energy economy," ColoradoPols wrote, when ripping Gardner's ad.\u000a\u000aCory Gardner's Press Secretary Matt Connelly found the critics' argument contradictory.\u000a\u000aIn an email, he wrote:

VWheatland - It's going to take imagination and innovation to tackle bringing clean energy to the world, and doing it in a big way. A group of four companies is doing just that, proposing an $8 billion project to supply Los Angeles with large amounts of electricity. In a news release on Tuesday, Duke Energy said four companies have jointly proposed a first-in-the-U.S. $8 billion green-energy initiative that would bring large amounts of electricity to Los Angeles by 2023. The project would require the construction of a 2.1 megawatt per hour wind farm in Wyoming and the world's biggest energy storage facilities in Utah, as well as a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting the two sites. The four companies involved in the joint proposal include Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission. "This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam - a landmark of the clean energy revolution," says Jeff Meyer, managing partner of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy. The four companies plan to submit their proposal to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015. The plans call for the construction of the wind farm between Chugwater and Wheatland, Wyoming. Power would be sent over a 525 mile long transmission line to Delta, Utah. The project developers say their plan will solve one of the problems with wind-generated power, intermittent winds. They have solved this problem by planning on constructing an energy storage facility at a salt-flat in Utah. Plans call for storing power in a cavern larger than the Empire State Building, hollowed out of a five-mile-long, two-mile deep salt deposit. According to the developers, compressed air will be used to turn eight turbines, releasing the electrical power. The facility will be located next to an existing power line running to the los Angeles area. "The technology has existed since the 1970s," Meyer said. "It is the matter of finding the right geologic formation. Not every salt dome is dense enough, big enough or hard enough. And not every salt dome is located 100 yards from the transmission line you need to connect into." Work on the wind-energy project is nor expected to start for another five years. But the Tuesday announcement was made because of a 2015 deadline for submitting proposals to the Southern California Public Power Authority for renewable energy and electricity storage.

VLAS VEGAS -- Construction has begun on a $1 billion solar power generating station in the Mojave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement Friday that since 2009, the Bureau of Land Management has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 50-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aSilver State North, owned by Canada-based Enbridge Inc., was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will be owned by a subsidiary of NextEra, and will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VWASHINGTON - The government will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way.'' The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world,'' said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.

VThe private spaceflight company SpaceX lit up the night sky over Florida early Sunday (Sept. 21) with the spectacular launch of Dragon spacecraft packed with supplies -- including the first 3D printer in space and a troop of 20 mice -- for the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThe unmanned Dragon space capsule launched into orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT). Ten minutes later, Dragon reached orbit and separated from the Falcon 9. It should reach the space station on Tuesday, Sept. 23.\u000a\u000a"Nothing like a good launch -- it's just fantastic," Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance, said during a post-launch briefing. "Everything was really perfect." [See photos from the SpaceX-4 Dragon mission]\u000a\u000aDragon is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo to the space station for NASA. The mission is SpaceX's fourth of 12 delivery missions for the U.S. space agency under a $1.6 billion deal. Sunday's flawless launch occurred one day after rain and thick clouds forced SpaceX to delay the launch on early Saturday (Sept. 20).\u000a\u000aBut skies were clear and the stars were out during the pre-dawn launch on Sunday morning. Sam Scimemi, NASA's International Space Station director, told reporters that the Falcon 9 appeared to be soaring though the constellation Orion after it took off.\u000a\u000a"It was a beautiful night," Scimemi said.\u000a\u000aFood, care packages and provisions for NASA's astronauts make up more than a third of the cargo onboard Dragon. But the spacecraft also has experiments and equipment that will eventually help scientists complete 255 research projects in total, according to NASA. In Dragon's trunk, there's an instrument dubbed RapidScat, which will be installed outside the space station to measure the speed and direction of ocean winds on Earth. Among the commercially funded experiments onboard Dragon is a materials-science test from the sports company Cobra Puma Golf designed to build a stronger golf club.\u000a\u000aDragon is also hauling the first space-grade 3D printer, built by Made in Space, which will test whether the on-the-spot manufacturing technology is viable without gravity.\u000a\u000aJeff Sheehy, senior technical officer of NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, said it is " a certainty" that NASA will eventually rely on 3D-printed tools and replacement parts that are made in space instead of traditional equipment sent up from Earth.\u000a\u000a"If we're really going to set up shop on Mars, we have to get there," Sheehy told reports during a briefing Friday morning. "We really can't afford to bring everything we need."\u000a\u000aA new X-ray machine called the Bone Densitometer, developed by Techshot, will arrive at the space station aboard Dragon. The system is designed to measure bone density loss -- but not in humans. Instead, it will be used to examine mice.\u000a\u000aThe 20 female mice inside Dragon will live inside NASA's new Rodent Research Hardware System to be installed on the space station. Before the launch, scientists said the mice would be just fine during the 10-minute trip to low-Earth orbit, even without cushy seats.\u000a\u000a"They move to the bottom of the cage and they hang tight until the ride is over," said Ruth Globus, a project scientist for the new rodent habitat at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.\u000a\u000aAfter launch, SpaceX performed a reusability test with the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. After separation, the booster reignited out over the Atlantic Ocean and went through a couple burns to bring it down into the water gently. SpaceX officials said they didn't expect to recover the first stage nor did they anticipate they would be able to see much of the nighttime test.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's goal had been to recover a Falcon 9 first stage with a touchdown on land by the end of 2014. But Koenigsmann said that type of demonstration was unlikely to happen during the next mission.\u000a\u000a"We're working actively with range safety to make this safe and also reliable in terms of public safety," Koenigsmann told reporters Friday.\u000a\u000aSpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has long-term ambitions to develop a fully reusable rocket will lower the cost of launching vehicles into space -- and eventually enable travel to Mars.\u000a\u000aIf all goes according to plan, Dragon will perform a series of carefully timed thruster firings to catch up to the space station on the morning of Tuesday (Sept. 23). Astronauts will use the space station's robotic arm to grab Dragon and attach it to a docking port.\u000a\u000aDragon will spend about four weeks at the space lab to allow astronauts to unload the new cargo and refill the capsule with about 3,800 lbs. (1,723 kg) experiments and other equipment to be returned to Earth.\u000a\u000aOrbital Sciences is the only other private American company besides SpaceX that NASA has hired to fly unmanned resupply missions to the space station. The Dulles, Virginia-based company has a $1.9-billion contract to fly eight missions total using its own Cygnus spacecraft and Antares rockets. Orbital Sciences launched its second official delivery flight to the space station in July, with its next mission set for October.\u000a\u000aUnlike Orbital Sciences' disposable spacecraft, which burn up in Earth's atmosphere at the end of their mission, Dragon has a heat shield that protects it from the brutal re-entry. About five and a half hours after Dragon leaves the space station in mid-October, it will deploy its parachutes and splash down off the coast of Baja California. A recovery boat will scoop the capsule out of the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, SpaceX also wants its Dragon capsules to make soft landings on the ground.\u000a\u000aJust this week, the Hawthorne, California-based spaceflight company was hired to help keep the space station fully staffed as well.\u000a\u000aSpaceX won $2.6 billion of NASA's Commercial Crew Transportation Capability award to launch American astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil by 2017 using a modified, manned version of Dragon. NASA, which announced the deal Tuesday (Sept. 16), gave Boeing a $4.2 billion slice of the award to provide the same space-taxi service with its CST-100 capsule. The United States lost the capability to send its own astronauts into space when NASA retired the space shuttle program in 2011.\u000a\u000a"This is kind of a crazy busy week for us here at NASA," Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, told reporters Friday (Sept. 19).\u000a\u000aIn addition to the commercial crew announcement and the SpaceX launch, NASA is also expecting its Mars-bound spacecraft MAVEN to enter orbit around the Red Planet late Sunday night.

VCAPE CANAVERAL Fla. - A Space Exploration Technologies cargo ship carrying an experimental 3-D printer and a habitat with 20 mice arrived at the International Space Station on Tuesday, ending a two-day journey.\u000a\u000aWorking from inside the station's windowed cupola module, flight engineer Alexander Gerst, a European Space Agency astronaut, used the station's 58-foot-long (18m) robotic arm to pluck the Dragon capsule from orbit at 6:52 a.m. EDT as the ships sailed 262 miles (422 km) over the Pacific Ocean.\u000a\u000a"This was, indeed, a great flight of Dragon," Gerst radioed to NASA Mission Control in Houston. "We're happy to have a new vehicle on board."\u000a\u000aThe capsule blasted off on Sunday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, which is built and flown by privately owned SpaceX, as the company is known. Including a 2012 test flight, Dragon cargo ships have now flown to the station five times.\u000a\u000aThe capsule is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kgs) of food, supplies and science gear, including an experimental 3-D printer designed to work in the zero-gravity environment of space and 20 mice that will be subjects in medical experiments to assess bone and muscle loss during long-duration spaceflights.\u000a\u000aDragon's unpressurized trunk compartment holds a $26 million instrument called RapidScat that will be robotically attached to the outside of the station to measure wind speeds over the oceans.\u000a\u000aCalifornia-based SpaceX, which is owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is one of two companies NASA hired to fly cargo to the station after the space shuttles were retired in 2011. SpaceX has a $1.6 billion contract for the work, which covers 12 flights.\u000a\u000aVirginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp runs a second U.S. supply line to the station under a $1.9 billon contract. Its next flight is scheduled for Oct. 21.\u000a\u000aSpaceX last week won a second, $2.6 billion NASA contract to upgrade the Dragon capsules to fly astronauts. A test flight is targeted for 2016.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. space agency also awarded a $4.2 billion contract to Boeing to develop a second space taxi that launches aboard pricy United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 5,000 pounds of NASA science investigations and cargo are on their way to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The cargo ship launched on the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 1:52 a.m. EDT Sunday, Sept. 21.\u000a\u000aThe mission is the company's fourth cargo delivery flight to the space station through a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract. Dragon's cargo will support experiments to be conducted by the crews of space station Expeditions 41 and 42.\u000a\u000aOne of the new Earth science investigations heading to the orbital laboratory is the International Space Station-Rapid Scatterometer. ISS-RapidScat monitors ocean winds from the vantage point of the space station. This space-based scatterometer is a remote sensing instrument that uses radar pulses reflected from the ocean's surface from different angles to calculate surface wind speed and direction. This information will be useful for weather forecasting and hurricane monitoring.\u000a\u000aDragon also will deliver the first-ever 3-D printer in space. The technology enables parts to be manufactured quickly and cheaply in space, instead of waiting for the next cargo resupply vehicle delivery. The research team also will gain valuable insight into improving 3-D printing technology on Earth by demonstrating it in microgravity.\u000a\u000aNew biomedical hardware launched aboard the spacecraft will help facilitate prolonged biological studies in microgravity. The Rodent Research Hardware and Operations Validation (Rodent Research-1) investigation provides a platform for long-duration rodent experiments in space. These investigations examine how microgravity affects animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may have direct impact toward human health on Earth.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spacecraft will also transport other biological research, including a new plant study. The Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware has supported a variety of plant growth experiments aboard the space station. The BRIC-19 investigation will focus on the growth and development in microgravity of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a small flowering plant related to cabbage. Because plant development on Earth is impacted by mechanical forces such as wind or a plant's own weight, researchers hope to improve understanding of how the growth responses of plants are altered by the absence of these forces when grown in microgravity.\u000a\u000aDragon is scheduled to be grappled at 7:04 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 23, by Expedition 41 Flight Engineer Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, using the space station's robotic arm to take hold of the spacecraft. NASA's Reid Wiseman will support Gerst in a backup position. Dragon is scheduled to depart the space station in mid-October for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja California, bringing from the space station almost 3,200 pounds of science, hardware and crew supplies.\u000a\u000aThe space station is a convergence of science, technology and human innovation that demonstrates new technologies and makes research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. NASA recently awarded contracts to SpaceX and The Boeing Company to transport U.S. crews to and from the space station with the goal of certifying those transportation systems in 2017.\u000a\u000aFor more information about SpaceX's fourth cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, visit:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nasa.gov/spacex\u000a\u000aFor more information about the International Space Station, visit:

VRadioactive wastes are a big pain and worse you cannot just wish them away. The US government is looking for trains which will haul radioactive waste from the nuclear power plants to their final resting place. However these trains are not going anywhere.\u000a\u000aThe US Department of Energy has literally put the cart before the horse when it asked different organizations for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel. However these cars are not going anywhere soon. The Federal Government plans to have an interim storage site ready by 2021 and a long term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aIt is still not clear where those sites will be located. The Obama administration is thinking about contracts which will build up, test and endorse the necessary rail equipment. The responsibility of regulating the shipments rests jointly with The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation.\u000a\u000aThe Energy Department has solicited public opinion on the question of buying the rail cars or just leasing it. The cars which will be used to transport the radioactive wastes have to be special. It should be robust enough to last 30 years, must run on standard speeds on regular tracks, must be built in a way to accommodate the casks containing the radioactive wastes, and will be used up to eight times in a year. The trains will also have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe US military sends the spent fuel rods from its reactors on Navy ships to Federal Labs for storage. In between 1979 to 2007, the civilian nuclear power industry has hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail annually. This averages 9 trips annually.\u000a\u000aSpent fuel rods are extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from the reactors. Operators first cool these spent fuel in huge water filled tanks before shifting it into massive casks where they remain in hope that in future suitable technology will be developed to convert these dangerous wastes into harmless materials.

VATLANTA | The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not respond to messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aBUY OR LEASE?\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration canceled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal time lines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."

VNew proposals by the Food and Drug Administration would make it easier for farmers to meet water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA proposed the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them for four years since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say it has been a challenge to balance the need for tighter food safety standards in the wake of major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe along with the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, said the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way" and said the rules are new terrain for the agency.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between using raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packinghouse without facing further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from the rules.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks.

VInterior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday unveiled a proposed roadmap for developing massive solar and wind projects in California's Mojave Desert while trying to minimize damage to desert habitat and animals.\u000a\u000aThe plan -- covering 22 million acres of public and private land -- follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's Mojave desert during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers siting sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday would designate a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted. Jewell's release Tuesday opened the plan for several months of public comment.\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Conservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species. The plant also proved unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be. "There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat. "The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VNEW YORK (AP) -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan for the city to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas by 2050, starting with efforts to make the city's buildings more energy efficient.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio unveiled the retrofitting plan on Sunday, the same day as a march focusing on global warming was scheduled to take place in Manhattan.\u000a\u000aMost of the city's greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to the energy needed to power electrical, heating and cooling systems in its buildings.\u000a\u000aThe plan calls for about 3,000 city-owned buildings that have "significant" energy use to be retrofitted by 2025. That includes schools, hospitals and libraries. The city will also offer incentives for private owners to upgrade their buildings.

VAmy Poehler is probably always willing to meet a Parks and Recreation viewer, but it seems the Saturday Night Live alum and her cast mates had a whole special day with a certain superfan. Joshua Ritter flew in with his family from Illinois as part of a once-in-a-lifetime experience created by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\u000a\u000aRitter took to Reddit to discuss his set visit and answered a question about Poehler and her generosity:\u000a\u000a"Amy Poehler was litt-rally [sic] one of the kindest and most loving people I've ever met. She just kept coming back for another conversation, hug, or picture... I had no idea that an A-list celebrity like herself could be so sweet and kind. It blew us away."\u000a\u000aRitter had similar praise for everyone he met during his day on the Parks and Recreation set, where he not only spent time with the cast, but the writers, directors and crew. He also got to participate in a studio tour. Said Ritter: "It was honestly the best experience of my life, and they cast/crew was more open and friendly than I could have ever dreamed."\u000a\u000aSuperfan Joshua Ritter visits the set of 'Parks and Recreation' (Courtesy Joshua Ritter)\u000a\u000aThis is the mission statement of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, taken from the organization's official website:\u000a\u000a"We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy."\u000a\u000aIt also makes the wonderful point that: "Wishes are more than just a nice thing... Whatever the odds, whatever the obstacles... wishes find a way to make the world better."\u000a\u000aRitter is living with Von-Hippel Lindau syndrome, a rare genetic condition. It causes his body to be predisposed to tumors. Ritter is currently a college freshman and, as The Hollywood Reporter notes, has already raised $115,000 for the St. Louis Children's Hospital. Through his story he wants to inspire others to support Make-A-Wish.\u000a\u000aRitter also told THR about Poehler's kindness on set:\u000a\u000a"You can tell the difference when someone is being nice just to be nice and when someone is genuinely nice and caring. It was really a huge surprise just how much she cared."\u000a\u000aIt wasn't just Poehler who impressed Ritter. Aziz Ansari came by to chat on his day off. Nick Offerman, according to Ritter, was exactly like his character Ron Swanson off-camera. Star Adam Scott, director Dean Holland and writer Matt Murray also chatted with the university student.\u000a\u000aWired reports this upcoming season is the seventh and final season for Parks and Recreation. Poehler is continuing with other projects, including a film with Tina Fey.\u000a\u000a[Image: Parks and Recreation/NBC]

V1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aATLANTA -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.\u000a\u000a1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VNigel Farage is in uncompromising mood. "Watch my lips. No . . . more . . . Martians".\u000a\u000aThe UKIP leader has vowed to take Earth out of the solar system unless the regulations governing asteroids and alien immigration are reformed.\u000a\u000a"Ask David Cameron how many flying saucers visited Britain last year and he doesn't know. That's how much of a shambles our space immigration policy is in. The only way we can guarantee that we won't be overrun with little green men is to tow the entire planet a few million miles out into space. I know what you're thinking - why would we want to take France with us? Well, it's basic physics - if we tried to cut France out we'd destabilise the Earth's crust and risk massive volcanic eruptions. Plus France is a useful buffer between us and those bloody Germans.\u000a\u000a"If it was possible just to tow Britain into space, believe me I'd go for it. The EU has actually approved a research grant to look into the proposal. Fastest thing I've ever seen them do. But it wouldn't work. And anyway, the rest of the planet would be meaningless without Britain."\u000a\u000aCritics of the scheme point to the scarcity of evidence of alien threat and the obvious risks involved in transporting the planet far away from its primary source of heat and light, but Farage is having none of it. "The trouble with scientists is they've never run a company, so they don't know how to solve real-world problems. I have run a company, and I drink beer, both of which make me infinitely more sensible than intellectuals, politicians and people who read the Guardian. The scientists are always bleating about 'how much we can learn from other civilisations' and 'oh, look at their technology, isn't it spiffing'. Well I don't want to learn from alien civilisations and if it wasn't invented here, I don't bloody want it. Does that make me a Little Englander? I don't think so. If I think about anything, which I mostly try not to. Immigrants out!'

VHEADLINE2New York Families & Farmers Benefit From Support\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food (CFSAF) today applauded Representative Chris Collins (R-NY-27) for cosponsoring the bipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which will establish national labeling standards for food and beverage products and eliminate the potential confusion and bureaucratic, costly red tape stemming from a 50-state patchwork of laws and regulations that could raise the could cost of food.\u000a\u000a"In sponsoring The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, Representative Collins is taking an important stand on behalf of consumers, food safety and science," said Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food. "American families deserve access to safe and affordable food, and this legislation will ensure that important food safety and labeling decisions are made by scientists, not political activists."\u000a\u000aThe Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act would prevent duplicative labeling, increased transportation costs, unnecessary product warehousing, burdensome product segregation plans and highly inefficient transportation requirements. A state-by-state patchwork of labeling laws would not advance food safety, inform consumers, or provide consistency in labeling.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the legislation reaffirms the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as America's sole authority on food safety and labeling requirements; requires the FDA to approve all new GMO ingredients before they are brought to market; sets a federal standard for the labeling definition of "natural;" and establishes federal standards for companies that wish to voluntarily label their products for the absence-of or presence-of GMO food ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe most influential food safety regulatory agencies and organizations around the world, including the FDA, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that GMOs are as safe as any other foods. In addition, studies have shown that unnecessary GMO labeling would increase costs for the average family by approximately $400 per year.\u000a\u000aThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is a broad-based coalition representing the entire American agriculture food chain - from farm to fork. CFSAF is committed to increasing understanding about the science and safety of GM technology and to advocating for a federal labeling solution.

VLos Angeles -- Three years into a historic drought, and in the midst of their state's driest year on record, Californians are at long last beginning to change their behavior, water analysts say.\u000a\u000aThe analysts, who say much more needs to be done to conserve California's water resources, point to two developments this week indicating that state residents are acknowledging the extent of the crisis.\u000a\u000aOne is data released Tuesday showing that the state reduced its water usage by 7.5 percent in July, a year-over-year savings of 17 billion gallons, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.\u000a\u000aThe other is a Field Poll published Wednesday indicating that state voters are likely to approve a $7.5 billion water bond - Proposition 1 on the November statewide ballot.\u000a\u000aExperts attribute the change to sustained media attention given the drought and more urgent policies enacted by state agencies, including both fines and incentives.\u000a\u000a"When you think about 38 million Californians, it sometimes seems like steering a huge oil tanker, but when public policy makers and media finally focus on it, it can finally come together - and has," says Richard Frank, professor of environmental practice at the University of California, Davis.\u000a\u000a"Californian's can and are using less and are realizing a huge potential to do even more in the future," says Doug Obegi, the water program staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He says his own organization's polling "shows there is a growing willingness to sacrifice for the drought, from improving efficiency and water recycling to rationing."\u000a\u000aHe says the 7.5 percent reduction is significant, even if substantially less than the 20 percent reduction called for by Gov. Jerry Brown upon declaring a state of emergency last Jan. 17.\u000a\u000aBut Mr. Obegi and others insist residents and agencies can and should do much more.\u000a\u000a"While this initial report is an improvement, we hope and trust that it is just a start," Felicia Marcus, the control board's chairwoman, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe reasons for the improvement, Obegi and others say, is increased focus on the drought after three years, media attention, and fines. A bulb-lit freeway sign on the main artery into downtown Los Angeles has notified drivers for months, "Historic drought. Please save water."\u000a\u000a"The state and local water agencies have started to draw a lot more attention to the need to save, and people are realizing a fourth year [of drought] is coming," Obegi says. "Districts have started sharing more, and some have been fined for wasting water - all this has galvanized a response from the public."\u000a\u000aProp. 1 includes $2.7 billion for water storage projects, $900 million for groundwater cleanup and monitoring, $725 million for water recycling, and $1.5 billion for watershed restoration programs. Prop. 1 asks voters to approve $7.12 billion in new bond debt and reallocates $425 million in existing unspent bond funds to bring the total spending plan to $7.5 billion.\u000a\u000aIt is a revised water bond, after legislators voted last month to significantly tweak an $11 billion water bond from 2010 with the scaled-back $7.5 billion version. The larger bond had been criticized for being "pork laden," including millions of dollars directed to other programs to make it more likely to pass the legislature.\u000a\u000aThe Field Poll indicated that 52 percent of likely voters said they would vote yes for the water bond, while 27 percent planned to vote no and 21 percent were undecided. Among voters who indicated they were already familiar with the water bond, support was 57 percent in favor and 25 percent against.\u000a\u000aField pollster Mark DiCamillo said that as people learn about the water bond, their support for it increases.\u000a\u000aEven though the Field Poll shows a 2-to-1 margin of approval for the bond, Obegi says a win for the measure will take a lot of work.\u000a\u000a"I'm cautiously optimistic," he says. "With lots of work and collective support it could get over the hump, but it will take some effort to educate the voters about what's at stake here. It's not going to be a cakewalk."\u000a\u000aThe water conservation data indicate a dramatic change in attitude. Despite Governor Brown's January call for a 20 percent cutback, by June usage actually increased by 1 percent. The state then imposed a mandatory requirement that all 440 of the state's major water districts implement drought response plans as of Aug. 1.\u000a\u000aMany districts took the high-profile and drastic step of imposing $500-a-day fines on residents for hose-washing a car without a shutoff nozzle, overwatering lawns so that runoff floods sidewalks and gutters, using water to clean driveways and sidewalks, and operating fountains without recirculation.\u000a\u000aBut monetary incentives seem to be helping as well.\u000a\u000aThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently hiked the rebate for ripping out a lawn and replacing it with drought-tolerant California flora from $2 to $3 per square foot - one of the highest incentive rebates in the state.\u000a\u000a"This is having a huge effect," says Motti Buskila, a horticulturalist who has run his own Sherman Oaks landscape business for 10 years. He says he used to get about 1 or 2 calls per year from those wanting to make the change. Now he has gotten 6 calls in the last six months.\u000a\u000a"A major number of people ripping out their urban grass lawns is another example of how a long-standing social behavior is beginning to change in Southern California and across the Southwest," says UC Davis' Professor Frank.\u000a\u000a"People see other people doing it and have begun to realize the possibilities are much broader than they thought. It's not just a bunch of gravel and some cactus, " Buskila says, "but rather a wide variety of really beautiful plants that attract bees and hummingbirds and butterflies."

VPARMA, Ohio - The cities of Parma, Parma Heights and Brooklyn are looking to share services through a regional dispatch center that will serve all three cities.\u000a\u000aCities blame budget troubles on the state, which over the past four years has cut about $900 million in funding for local governments and also eliminated the estate tax. But few are seriously considering saving money by consolidating, a move the state is pushing.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, the Northeast Ohio Media Group found that many cities are considering raising taxes instead of sharing services.\u000a\u000aHowever, Parma, Parma Heights and Brooklyn are among the few that are not raising taxes and planning to share services instead. The three cities already offer mutual aid during emergencies, so the three mayors said it makes sense to take it a step farther.\u000a\u000aParma Mayor Tim DeGeeter said this is a continuum of regionalization for the three cities.\u000a\u000a"My view as mayor of Parma is if we can do it and it helps save money and doesn't cost us any money, that's a win for the region," he said.\u000a\u000aThe cities will create an intergovernmental agreement over cost-sharing based on the populations of each city and the 911-call activity, DeGeeter said Thursday.\u000a\u000aDeGeeter made the announcement at a joint-news conference with Parma Heights Mayor Mike Byrne, Brooklyn Mayor Richard Balbier and safety officials from the three cities.\u000a\u000aDeGeeter said they expect agencies also will offer grant money to help fund the center because of the partnership between the cities.\u000a\u000aThe regional dispatch center will be located in Parma, and currently the center has 16 dispatchers. But Parma Safety Director Greg Baeppler said they will hire at least 10 more dispatchers in the next few months to ensure better service for the residents.\u000a\u000aCurrently Brooklyn and Parma Heights do not offer emergency medical dispatch, which is when a dispatcher can talk a caller through life-saving procedures while waiting for paramedics.\u000a\u000aParma dispatchers are trained in emergency medical dispatch, and the new hires at the regional dispatch center will be as well, so that service will now be available to Parma Heights and Brooklyn residents.\u000a\u000aByrne said this shared center will improve services to Parma Heights residents while helping the three cities save money. However, officials said the exact cost and amounts saved are still unknown at this time.\u000a\u000a"The emergency medical dispatch component will immediately improve the current level of service available to our residents along with up-to-the date technology. Our residents will benefit from this personal and immediate assistance," Byrne said. "It also goes without saying that a regional dispatch center optimizes staffing levels."\u000a\u000aHe said he is fortunate to be working with "such forward thinking mayors."\u000a\u000a"Many of you know this is not the first time that we have worked together or shared services," Byrne said. "I know we will continue to look for ways to improve the level of services for our residents while at the same time being more cost effective and efficient."\u000a\u000aDeGeeter said the city already shares some services with neighboring Parma Heights and Brooklyn, including loaning out Parma's auxiliary police force, fire department mutual aid and police assistance during major accidents or crimes.\u000a\u000a"So this consolidated dispatcher center is yet another way we are regionalizing some services to the benefit of city budgets and ultimately to the taxpayer," DeGeeter said.\u000a\u000aBalbier said combing services for the three cities "makes a lot of sense."\u000a\u000aBrooklyn, which borders Cleveland on three sides, only has one suburb border -- Parma. Balbier said when there is an emergency Parma and Parma Heights both assist Brooklyn immediately.\u000a\u000aHe also said that by sharing a dispatch center the police and fire departments in Parma, Parma Heights and Brooklyn would have access to all calls for service and share radios.\u000a\u000aBalbier said if there are any issues, the cities will work together to find a solution.\u000a\u000a"With three brains like this, how could we lose," he said. "So I think it's a good thing, and I look forward to a long and lasting dispatch center."

VCity to lower suggested water use reduction from 30 percent to 20 percent\u000a\u000aThe city's water fund will chip in $45,000 to help get the word out about mandatory water conservation measures to customers of the Menlo Park Municipal Water District.\u000a\u000aThe council voted 5-0 on Sept. 9 to allocate the money, and, as an aside, requested that the city not deploy robocalls as part of its outreach after a spirited protest by one resident during the meeting.\u000a\u000a"I do have to say that robocalls are ineffective. I think people will abuse more water if they get a robocall just because they're angry about the robocall," said Councilman Rich Cline, who shared the resident's sentiment that the city should just say no to the calls.\u000a\u000aWhile staff had asked for $57,000 for the outreach, a consensus was reached that $45,000 would be sufficient to start with. The outreach will include letters mailed to each water district customer, doorhangers, brochures and newspaper advertisements, according to the staff report.\u000a\u000aThe council fielded suggestions to trim the cost, encouraging the city to go beyond the traditional outreach by using online alerts and existing community networks, such as those found at schools, churches and disaster preparedness groups. Menlo Park could also send postcards that refer people to a website instead of long mailers, to save money as well as paper, given that most will likely just get tossed in the trash anyway, they concluded.\u000a\u000aThe city's water district supplies an estimated 14,100 customers. While Menlo Park is looking for ways to collaborate with neighboring jurisdictions on outreach, Interim Public Works Director Jesse Quirion said the challenge is that each agency is implementing different restrictions.\u000a\u000a"We can look to them for staff assistance, but our mailers are going to be different," Mr. Quirion said.\u000a\u000aThe city has also started the process of lowering the suggested water use reduction from 30 percent to 20 percent, the interim public works director said. The state had suggested the higher reduction, but Menlo Park's implementation of voluntary water conservation measures in recent years made that a difficult target, according to the city and residents.\u000a\u000aThe new reduction target is "a great story for our residents who have had to cut so much," Mayor Ray Mueller noted.

VLas Vegas * Construction has begun on a $1 billion solar power generating station in the Mohave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said Friday that since 2009, the BLM has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 25-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aA subsidiary of NextEra will own both plants.\u000a\u000aSilver State North was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VLos Angeles * Four energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam that produces enough power for 1.3 million people annually. It calls for construction of an expansive wind farm 40 miles north of Cheyenne and a massive energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aSuccess hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be completing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, which delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000a-- -- --\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VInventHelp, founded in 1984 in Pittsburgh, is submitting the Mag Duster to appropriate companies for their consideration.\u000a\u000aForeign elements getting into an M-16 via an open magazine well can cause the rifle to malfunction, which can make the difference between life and death for soldiers and law-enforcement officers. "I served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, so I'm familiar with how vulnerable these firearms are," said an inventor from Lincoln, Neb., "and I've seen many of them jam during training because of this."\u000a\u000aIn order to solve this problem, he designed the patent-pending MAG DUSTER, an accessory that keeps an M-16-style rifle safe from dust, dirt, sand, mud and debris when its magazine well is empty. This helps prevent malfunctions such as jams, and it doesn't impede magazine insertion or removal. As a result, it improves rifle reliability, which promotes peace of mind in combat situations. It also is compatible with the AR-15, M-4 and other variants. The accessory is ideal for the military and law-enforcement officers, as well as rifle enthusiasts.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement.

VHONOLULU Hawaiian Electric Co. has filed an ambitious plan to have 65 percent of its power come from renewable energy within 16 years.\u000a\u000aThe plan was filed late Tuesday with the Public Utilities Commission, just minutes before its deadline to do so. The company was under orders from the state agency to reduce energy costs and accommodate more solar power and other renewable energy on the grid.\u000a\u000aThe company also said the plan would cut customer bills by 20 percent, and it wants to convert remaining oil-fired power plants to liquefied natural gas, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\u000a\u000aHawaii News Now reported the commission will review the filing to determine if the plan is consistent with its earlier order and the state's energy goals.\u000a\u000aHawaiian Electric wants to nearly triple the amount of solar power by 2030. However, the plan outlines increased costs for residents using solar power, and the newspaper reports this could cause the company to not meet its goal.\u000a\u000aThere are three potential charges outlined in the plan for residents who power their homes with solar power.\u000a\u000aBesides a one-time connection fee, the changes would include increasing a fixed monthly charge from as low as $17 to $71 for solar customers on Oahu, and decreasing the amount the company pays residents for sending power to the grid. Residents are currently paid more than 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the new plans calls for that to be decreased to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.\u000a\u000aThe company says the plan is to gradually introduce these new costs, which will bring fairness to all utility customers. The plan also says solar customers didn't pay enough of the utility's fixed costs.\u000a\u000aMaking the costs more equal between solar and non-solar customers will allow the utility to cut bills for non-solar users by 20 percent, the company estimated.\u000a\u000aA state law passed in 2009 requires Hawaii's electric utilities to get 40 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2030.

VWhat will the world look like in 2025? Expect a lot more solar power. In fact, according to a report by Thomson Reuters, in 2025, solar will be the primary source of energy on our planet.\u000a\u000a2025 may sound a ways off, but it's only 11 years away. Solar power being that prominent that soon may sound overly optimistic, but the Thomson Reuters researchers have a (rational) basis for their conclusion.\u000a\u000aTo get there, the researchers scoured the available literature on R&D, looking at citation rankings, most-cited papers, hot topics, patents, and research fronts. Analyzing these sources can give a good indication of the potential of a technology or area of research.\u000a\u000aSolar, they found, has enormous potential, enough to be identified as one of the major trends for our near future. The researchers attribute the rise of solar to improvements in efficiency and technology -- including, of course, storage technology.\u000a\u000aSolar Industry Magazine provides a closer look at the methods used for the study and notes that because it takes a while to see the results of research, and so much research has been happening, we are now experiencing a lag in its applications. By 2025, we will see the fruits of much of the R&D that's been taking place.\u000a\u000aStill not convinced? Take a look at this chart on RenewEconomy, showing that green NGOs -- "those accused in dealing in 'fantasy'" -- are more realistically estimating solar capacity forecasts than "established" energy experts, in this case the International Energy Agency.\u000a\u000aA look at Germany and Australia can also give a glimpse into our future. In Australia, solar has been a big factor in an unprecedented oversupply of energy -- one "never before seen in the history of the national electricity market." That means that in the southeastern part of the country, new energy generation won't be needed for another 10 years, even in a worst-case scenario. And there's enough power to ensure energy reliability.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of reliability, it turns out that Germany has one of the most reliable power grids in the world, despite its major adoption of renewable energy sources. Germany got 31% of its power from solar and other renewables in the first half of 2014 and has a goal of getting 80% of its energy from renewables by 2050.\u000a\u000aBack in the U.S., 74% of new electric generating capacity in the first quarter of this year came from solar. That took the U.S. solar PV total to 14.8 GW of installed capacity, enough to power 3 million homes. And that's only a start. Even Merrill Lynch is expecting demand for solar to "soar" in the next few years.\u000a\u000aWe know by now that as solar grows, prices come down and jobs are created. That too is being borne out in Australia, where as in the U.S., the solar industry employs more people now than the coal industry.\u000a\u000aSome are saying that by 2020 -- a mere six years from now -- solar power will even be the cheapest energy source in the world.

VSACRAMENTO Calif. (Reuters) - Facing acute water shortages in some communities and mandatory restrictions on watering lawns, Californians saved 17 billion gallons of water in July, enough to fill 26,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the state said.\u000a\u000aThe amount saved falls short of the 20 percent reduction in use called for by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, but represents significant cutbacks in water use as the most populous U.S. state struggles through its third year of a devastating drought.\u000a\u000a?Every action, from taking a shorter shower, to putting a lawn on a water diet, to replacing turf with drought-tolerant\u000a\u000alandscaping, contributes to every community?s water security," Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board said Tuesday.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is in its third year of a devastating drought that has forced farmers to leave fields unplanted and left communities reliant on well water with little to drink.\u000a\u000aThe data released Tuesday is the first monthly information on water use gathered by the state since it began requiring local water agencies to file monthly conservation reports earlier this summer.\u000a\u000aIt showed that overall, Californians cut water use by about 7.5 percent over July of 2013.\u000a\u000aIn some communities, including stricken regions in the northern part of the state, consumers and businesses saved far more than that, cutting consumption by half over last year, the water board said.\u000a\u000aOverall, the water saved was enough to for 1.7 billion people to each take a five-minute shower, the state said.\u000a\u000aThe mandatory conservation measures forbid such actions as letting sprinklers drench driveways and concrete walkways while watering the lawn, using a hose without a shut-off valve to wash a car and using drinkable water in fountains that do not recirculate it.\u000a\u000aSome communities have banned residents from filling their swimming pools, and in Southern California, residents have removed 2.5 million square feet of turf from their front and back yards, replacing water-thirsty grass with drought tolerant plants and other landscaping.\u000a\u000aMarcus called for still more conservation as the drought drags on.\u000a\u000a"Wasting previous potable water today imperils our communities' future," she said.

VThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.

VSteve Marcus\u000a\u000aA view of solar panels at the Enbridge Silver State North Solar Project in Primm Monday, May 7, 2012. Silver State North, owned by Canada-based Enbridge Inc., sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area. Construction is underway on the 250-megawatt Silver State South project, which is adjacent to the 50-megawatt Silver State North array.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press\u000a\u000aFriday, Sept. 5, 2014 | 6:25 p.m.\u000a\u000aConstruction has begun on a $1 billion solar power generating station in the Mojave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement Friday that since 2009, the Bureau of Land Management has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 50-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aSilver State North, owned by Canada-based Enbridge Inc., was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will be owned by a subsidiary of NextEra, and will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in Southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VHEADLINE2California microbrewery installs Enphase Microinverter system to maximize solar energy production and advance its sustainability efforts\u000a\u000aPETALUMA, Calif., Aug 28, 2014 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Enphase Energy announced today that North State Solar Energy, a Northern California-based general contractor that specializes in solar-electric installations for residential, commercial and agricultural projects, has installed an Enphase-equipped photovoltaic (PV) system at Bear Republic Brewing Co.'s Cloverdale facility. Both the 30.2 kilowatt (KW) rooftop solar array and a second, soon-to-be-installed 136.6 KW canopy system feature Enphase M250 American Pride Microinverters assembled in Milpitas, California.\u000a\u000a"We raise a toast to Bear Republic's decision to go solar and to work with fellow homegrown American success stories such as Enphase and North State Solar," said Paul Nahi, CEO of Enphase. "A commitment to quality and sustainability drives all three companies, and we look forward to helping reduce Bear Republic's energy bill and carbon footprint."\u000a\u000aThe project marks the latest collaboration between Enphase and North State Solar. The solar contractor recently became an exclusive Enphase 2014 American Pride Partner for deployment of Enphase's new American Pride Microinverters in commercial and residential solar installations throughout Northern and Central California.\u000a\u000a"A big reason why we have been successful in bidding for Bear Republic and other projects with Enphase Systems is their track record for quality and reliability," explained Mike Houar, president of North State Solar. "We've installed tens of thousands of Enphase microinverters, and it is, by far, the most reliable and highest production solar energy system in the industry."\u000a\u000aThe solar project is part of a sustainability initiative for Bear Republic, which is also implementing technology to treat wastewater from the brewing process while capturing electricity and heat that goes straight back into the production process.\u000a\u000a"We chose Enphase microinverter systems over string inverters because the design increases overall energy output," said Peter Kruger, master brewer at Bear Republic. "If one part of the system suffers a drop in production, there's no effect on the other parts of the system."\u000a\u000aNOTE: A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Bear Republic solar power system will take place Thursday, August 28, from noon to 2 p.m. at the Cloverdale facility.\u000a\u000aAbout Enphase Energy, Inc.\u000a\u000aEnphase Energy delivers microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production, simplifies design and installation, improves system uptime and reliability, reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) - Four energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture - if approved and financed - would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam that produces enough power for 1.3 million people annually. It calls for construction of an expansive wind farm 40 miles north of Cheyenne and a massive energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aSuccess hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be completing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, which delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A commercial SpaceX Dragon supply ship packed with NASA experiments -- including 20 mice destined for the final frontier -- will have wait at least one more day to blast into space after bad weather thwarted a launch attempt early Saturday (Sept. 20).\u000a\u000aA drizzling pre-dawn rain and thick clouds lingered over SpaceX's Florida launch pad here, forcing the company to postpone its Dragon delivery mission to the International Space Station for NASA until Sunday (Sept. 21). The SpaceX-built Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon capsule is now set to launch at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT) on Sunday.\u000a\u000aYou can watch the SpaceX launch webcast live Sunday on Space.com, courtesy of NASA TV. The webcast will begin at 12:45 a.m. EDT (0445 GMT). [See photos from the SpaceX-4 cargo mission]\u000a\u000a"We have scrubbed today's launch opportunity because of inclement weather," NASA spokesman Mike Curie said during the countdown commentary about a half hour before the targeted 2:14 a.m. EDT (0614 GMT) launch time on Saturday.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Dragon is carrying some unusual cargo among its 2.5 tons of astronaut supplies, science experiments and new hardware being hauled to the space station. That haul includes 20 mice that will live inside a new rodent habitat, the first 3D printer built for space and a NASA device called RapidScat, designed to track ocean winds on Earth from the space station.\u000a\u000aThe forecast for Sunday calls for a 60-percent chance of good launch weather for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon, according to NASA weather experts. If all goes well, the Dragon spacecraft will arrive at the station on Tuesday (Sept. 23) and be captured by astronauts using the outpost's robotic arm.\u000a\u000a"We're hoping the weather will be more favorable," Curie said.\u000a\u000aThe mission is the fourth of 12 SpaceX delivery missions to the space station using its Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rockets. The Hawthorne, California-based company has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for those resupply flights. NASA also has a separate cargo delivery contract with the Virginia-based company Orbital Sciences, which uses its own Antares rockets and Cygnus spacecraft for the flights.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, NASA also picked SpaceX as one of two companies that will fly American astronauts to the station on commercial space taxis. The space agency tapped SpaceX's manned Dragon Version 2 spacecraft and the Boeing CST-100 capsule as the future ferry ships for U.S. astronauts headed to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aVisit Space.com early Sunday for complete coverage of SpaceX's latest Dragon launch for NASA.

VThe private spaceflight company SpaceX lit up the night sky over Florida early Sunday (Sept. 21) with the spectacular launch of Dragon spacecraft packed with supplies -- including the first 3D printer in space and a troop of 20 mice -- for the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThe unmanned Dragon space capsule launched into orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT). Ten minutes later, Dragon reached orbit and separated from the Falcon 9. It should reach the space station on Tuesday, Sept. 23.\u000a\u000a"Nothing like a good launch -- it's just fantastic," Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance, said during a post-launch briefing. "Everything was really perfect." [See photos from the SpaceX-4 Dragon mission]\u000a\u000aDragon is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo to the space station for NASA. The mission is SpaceX's fourth of 12 delivery missions for the U.S. space agency under a $1.6 billion deal. Sunday's flawless launch occurred one day after rain and thick clouds forced SpaceX to delay the launch on early Saturday (Sept. 20).\u000a\u000aBut skies were clear and the stars were out during the pre-dawn launch on Sunday morning. Sam Scimemi, NASA's International Space Station director, told reporters that the Falcon 9 appeared to be soaring though the constellation Orion after it took off.\u000a\u000a"It was a beautiful night," Scimemi said.\u000a\u000aFood, care packages and provisions for NASA's astronauts make up more than a third of the cargo onboard Dragon. But the spacecraft also has experiments and equipment that will eventually help scientists complete 255 research projects in total, according to NASA. In Dragon's trunk, there's an instrument dubbed RapidScat, which will be installed outside the space station to measure the speed and direction of ocean winds on Earth. Among the commercially funded experiments onboard Dragon is a materials-science test from the sports company Cobra Puma Golf designed to build a stronger golf club.\u000a\u000aDragon is also hauling the first space-grade 3D printer, built by Made in Space, which will test whether the on-the-spot manufacturing technology is viable without gravity.\u000a\u000aJeff Sheehy, senior technical officer of NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, said it is " a certainty" that NASA will eventually rely on 3D-printed tools and replacement parts that are made in space instead of traditional equipment sent up from Earth.\u000a\u000a"If we're really going to set up shop on Mars, we have to get there," Sheehy told reports during a briefing Friday morning. "We really can't afford to bring everything we need."\u000a\u000aA new X-ray machine called the Bone Densitometer, developed by Techshot, will arrive at the space station aboard Dragon. The system is designed to measure bone density loss -- but not in humans. Instead, it will be used to examine mice.\u000a\u000aThe 20 female mice inside Dragon will live inside NASA's new Rodent Research Hardware System to be installed on the space station. Before the launch, scientists said the mice would be just fine during the 10-minute trip to low-Earth orbit, even without cushy seats.\u000a\u000a"They move to the bottom of the cage and they hang tight until the ride is over," said Ruth Globus, a project scientist for the new rodent habitat at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.\u000a\u000aAfter launch, SpaceX performed a reusability test with the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. After separation, the booster reignited out over the Atlantic Ocean and went through a couple burns to bring it down into the water gently. SpaceX officials said they didn't expect to recover the first stage nor did they anticipate they would be able to see much of the nighttime test.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's goal had been to recover a Falcon 9 first stage with a touchdown on land by the end of 2014. But Koenigsmann said that type of demonstration was unlikely to happen during the next mission.\u000a\u000a"We're working actively with range safety to make this safe and also reliable in terms of public safety," Koenigsmann told reporters Friday.\u000a\u000aSpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has long-term ambitions to develop a fully reusable rocket will lower the cost of launching vehicles into space -- and eventually enable travel to Mars.\u000a\u000aIf all goes according to plan, Dragon will perform a series of carefully timed thruster firings to catch up to the space station on the morning of Tuesday (Sept. 23). Astronauts will use the space station's robotic arm to grab Dragon and attach it to a docking port.\u000a\u000aDragon will spend about four weeks at the space lab to allow astronauts to unload the new cargo and refill the capsule with about 3,800 lbs. (1,723 kg) experiments and other equipment to be returned to Earth.\u000a\u000aOrbital Sciences is the only other private American company besides SpaceX that NASA has hired to fly unmanned resupply missions to the space station. The Dulles, Virginia-based company has a $1.9-billion contract to fly eight missions total using its own Cygnus spacecraft and Antares rockets. Orbital Sciences launched its second official delivery flight to the space station in July, with its next mission set for October.\u000a\u000aUnlike Orbital Sciences' disposable spacecraft, which burn up in Earth's atmosphere at the end of their mission, Dragon has a heat shield that protects it from the brutal re-entry. About five and a half hours after Dragon leaves the space station in mid-October, it will deploy its parachutes and splash down off the coast of Baja California. A recovery boat will scoop the capsule out of the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, SpaceX also wants its Dragon capsules to make soft landings on the ground.\u000a\u000aJust this week, the Hawthorne, California-based spaceflight company was hired to help keep the space station fully staffed as well.\u000a\u000aSpaceX won $2.6 billion of NASA's Commercial Crew Transportation Capability award to launch American astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil by 2017 using a modified, manned version of Dragon. NASA, which announced the deal Tuesday (Sept. 16), gave Boeing a $4.2 billion slice of the award to provide the same space-taxi service with its CST-100 capsule. The United States lost the capability to send its own astronauts into space when NASA retired the space shuttle program in 2011.\u000a\u000a"This is kind of a crazy busy week for us here at NASA," Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, told reporters Friday (Sept. 19).\u000a\u000aIn addition to the commercial crew announcement and the SpaceX launch, NASA is also expecting its Mars-bound spacecraft MAVEN to enter orbit around the Red Planet late Sunday night.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 SPACE.com, a TechMediaNetwork company.

VNEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan for the city to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas by 2050, starting with efforts to make the city's buildings more energy efficient.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio unveiled the retrofitting plan on Sunday, the same day as the People's Climate March focusing on global warming in being held in Manhattan.\u000a\u000aMost of the city's greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to the energy needed to power electrical, heating and cooling systems in its buildings.\u000a\u000aThe plan calls for about 3,000 city-owned buildings that have "significant" energy use to be retrofitted by 2025. That includes schools, hospitals and libraries.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food (CFSAF) today applauded Representative Chris Collins (R-NY-27) for cosponsoring the bipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which will establish national labeling standards for food and beverage products and eliminate the potential confusion and bureaucratic, costly red tape stemming from a 50-state patchwork of laws and regulations that could raise the could cost of food.\u000a\u000a"In sponsoring The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, Representative Collins is taking an important stand on behalf of consumers, food safety and science," said Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food. "American families deserve access to safe and affordable food, and this legislation will ensure that important food safety and labeling decisions are made by scientists, not political activists."\u000a\u000aThe Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act would prevent duplicative labeling, increased transportation costs, unnecessary product warehousing, burdensome product segregation plans and highly inefficient transportation requirements. A state-by-state patchwork of labeling laws would not advance food safety, inform consumers, or provide consistency in labeling.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the legislation reaffirms the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as America's sole authority on food safety and labeling requirements; requires the FDA to approve all new GMO ingredients before they are brought to market; sets a federal standard for the labeling definition of "natural;" and establishes federal standards for companies that wish to voluntarily label their products for the absence-of or presence-of GMO food ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe most influential food safety regulatory agencies and organizations around the world, including the FDA, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that GMOs are as safe as any other foods. In addition, studies have shown that unnecessary GMO labeling would increase costs for the average family by approximately $400 per year.\u000a\u000aThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is a broad-based coalition representing the entire American agriculture food chain - from farm to fork. CFSAF is committed to increasing understanding about the science and safety of GM technology and to advocating for a federal labeling solution.

VSurrounded by windmills, Colorado Republican Senate candidate Cory Gardner touts his support of green-energy initiative when he was a state legislator in a new ad but neglects to mention that the law was revoked after just two years for being completely ineffective.\u000a\u000aThe ad debuted on Sept. 1 and was clearly designed to show Gardner as an environmentally friendly legislator who can work across the aisle on renewable energy initiatives, turf that's already been staked out by his opponent, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall.\u000a\u000aUdall has spent a great deal of time and money painting Gardner as the Big Energy candidate because of his support of oil and gas production in Colorado.\u000a\u000aGardner's new ad is clearly meant to counter that image, but it's backfiring in a big way.\u000a\u000a"So what's a Republican like me doing at a wind farm?" Gardner asks at the beginning of the outdoorsy ad, before announcing that when he was a state legislator, he "co-wrote the law to launch our state's green energy industry."\u000a\u000aHe's referring to a bill he introduced in 2007, but which wasn't adopted until 2010 -- after he'd been elected to Congress -- to help finance wind farms and other alternative energy initiatives.\u000a\u000aGardner's critics tore to pieces the claim that the law did anything to help the alternative energy industry in Colorado, blasting the law as a prime example of do-nothing legislation that was repealed, in a bipartisan vote, as a failure two years later.\u000a\u000aDenver's CBS 4 reported that the law was designed in such a way that it could never issue bonds needed to finance renewable energy projects.\u000a\u000a"The authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress," CBS 4 reported. "By 2012 the authority was scrapped."\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," said Tom Plant, who oversaw the renewable energy authority Gardner's law created as the head of the state energy office under Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," he told the station.\u000a\u000aCritics also bristled at Gardner's attempt to take credit for creating Colorado's so-called green energy industry, which has long been the sole talking point of former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter.\u000a\u000aRitter heads the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, and has advised President Obama on strategies for enacting his energy policy during his second term, according to The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aIn a written statement to CBS 4, Gardner spokesman Alex Siciliano defended the legislation and took aim at those who criticize it for being "imperfect."\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect," he said. "That's one reason nothing gets done."\u000a\u000aFollow Greg on Twitter

VWhat if we could peer into the future and see the consequences of the decisions we make today? In a way, we can.\u000a\u000aAccording to Washington state economists, a carbon tax high enough to achieve Gov. Jay Inslee's stated climate change goals would increase gasoline prices almost 60 percent over time and raise natural gas prices -- currently our most affordable energy -- nearly 35 percent. The carbon tax is only one part of Inslee's climate change agenda. How much will the rest of it cost Washington families?\u000a\u000aAt this point, we don't know precisely how the governor's energy agenda will affect our economy. But we can see that a misguided and mismanaged "green" agenda can cripple a nation's economy and stick struggling families with the bill.\u000a\u000aGermany has launched a program to virtually eliminate the use of fossil fuel and nuclear energy by 2050. Called Energiewende, or energy revolution, it seeks to build a nationwide infrastructure of wind and solar power at an estimated cost of one trillion euros. Chancellor Angela Merkel says, "No country of Germany's scale has pursued such a radical shift in its energy supply."\u000a\u000aWell, that much is true. And judging from the results, no country will.\u000a\u000aThe program has been marked by poor judgment, ineptitude and mind-boggling cost overruns.\u000a\u000aTo take advantage of more consistent winds, the government encouraged wind producers to site their turbines offshore. But to protect shoreline ecosystems, the wind farms were pushed up to 60 miles offshore, where rough seas and construction challenges have sent costs soaring.\u000a\u000aElectricity generated by wind farms in northern Germany must be moved to the industrial south, but The Wall Street Journal reports that Germany has no north-south transmission line. The government must build and upgrade more than 4,000 miles of high-voltage power lines, but because of delays, community opposition and indecision, only 220 miles have been completed.\u000a\u000aTo encourage expansion of wind and solar power, the German government set guaranteed prices for renewable energy developers, paid for by surcharges on people's electricity bills.\u000a\u000aDer Spiegel, Germany's version of Time magazine, reports that this year German consumers will be forced to pay $26 billion for electricity that sells for less than $4 billion on the open market. More than 300,000 German families a year have their electricity cut off because of unpaid bills. There's even a name for it: energy poverty.\u000a\u000aEnergy costs for employers have jumped 60 percent over five years and nearly 75 percent of Germany's small and midsize companies say rising energy costs are a major risk, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u000a\u000aGlobal giant BASF, which has more than 50,000 employees in Germany, announced in May it would substantially reduce its investments there because of the country's energy policy. A major German industrial gas company cited the risky energy policies when it shelved plans to expand production there, opting instead to build in France.\u000a\u000aIronically, Washington state has benefited from Germany's problems.\u000a\u000aCiting Washington's affordable electricity, SGL Carbon, a German maker of carbon-based products for BMW autos, decided to invest $200 million in a new plant in Moses Lake instead of investing in its home country.\u000a\u000aGermany's climate change agenda is putting its entire economy at risk, even though it contributes little more than two percent of the world's greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aWill we do the same?\u000a\u000aOur state contributes only 3/10th of one percent of the world's greenhouse gases. Even if we gutted our economy with crushing "green" regulations, would it have any impact on global climate? Will it be worth the cost?\u000a\u000aAs Gov. Inslee develops his climate change policy to be announced next year, he needs to answer those questions.

VThe push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by the Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000aCompany officials said the underground storage site could yield as much electricity as a large nuclear power plant, or enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million homes.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VInventHelp, a leading inventor service company, is working to submit the Kitchen Grease Absorber to companies in the hopes of a good faith review.\u000a\u000a"I saw a soup can filled with used cooking grease resting on my kitchen counter, and it occurred to me that there had to be a more hygienic and convenient way to get rid of such grease," said an inventor from Brooklyn Center, Minn.\u000a\u000aHe created a prototype for the Kitchen Grease Absorber to provide a quick, easy method of disposing of hot cooking oils and grease. The invention stops the practice of pouring used oil or grease into the kitchen sink. This prevents pipes from clogging and the need to hire a plumber. The tool also ends the need to store used oil and grease in jars, cans or other containers. Furthermore, the device keeps the kitchen looking neat and tidy.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Edina office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

VCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A commercial SpaceX Dragon supply ship packed with NASA experiments -- including 20 mice destined for the final frontier -- will have wait at least one more day to blast into space after bad weather thwarted a launch attempt early Saturday (Sept. 20).\u000a\u000aA drizzling pre-dawn rain and thick clouds lingered over SpaceX's Florida launch pad here, forcing the company to postpone its Dragon delivery mission to the International Space Station for NASA until Sunday (Sept. 21). The SpaceX-built Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon capsule is now set to launch at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT) on Sunday.\u000a\u000aYou can watch the SpaceX launch webcast live Sunday on Space.com, courtesy of NASA TV. The webcast will begin at 12:45 a.m. EDT (0445 GMT). [See photos from the SpaceX-4 cargo mission]\u000a\u000a"We have scrubbed today's launch opportunity because of inclement weather," NASA spokesman Mike Curie said during the countdown commentary about a half hour before the targeted 2:14 a.m. EDT (0614 GMT) launch time on Saturday.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Dragon is carrying some unusual cargo among its 2.5 tons of astronaut supplies, science experiments and new hardware being hauled to the space station. That haul includes 20 mice that will live inside a new rodent habitat, the first 3D printer built for space and a NASA device called RapidScat, designed to track ocean winds on Earth from the space station.\u000a\u000aThe forecast for Sunday calls for a 40-percent chance of good launch weather for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon, according to NASA weather experts. If all goes well, the Dragon spacecraft will arrive at the station on Tuesday (Sept. 23) and be captured by astronauts using the outpost's robotic arm.\u000a\u000a"We're hoping the weather will be more favorable," Curie said.\u000a\u000aThe mission is the fourth of 12 SpaceX delivery missions to the space station using its Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rockets. The Hawthorne, California-based company has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for those resupply flights. NASA also has a separate cargo delivery contract with the Virginia-based company Orbital Sciences, which uses its own Antares rockets and Cygnus spacecraft for the flights.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, NASA also picked SpaceX as one of two companies that will fly American astronauts to the station on commercial space taxis. The space agency tapped SpaceX's manned Dragon Version 2 spacecraft and the Boeing CST-100 capsule as the future ferry ships for U.S. astronauts headed to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aVisit Space.com early Sunday for complete coverage of SpaceX's latest Dragon launch for NASA. To follow the countdown with live updates, visit our partner Spaceflight Now's Mission Status Center.\u000a\u000aEditor's note: This story was updated to correct the launch weather forecast from NASA, which calls for a 40-percent chance of good launch weather on Sunday for SpaceX's Dragon mission.

VThe tainted oil scandal and the government's handling of the issue is similar to all past food safety scandals, exposing slack regulations and laws from the central government down to local governments, a lack of horizontal linkages and potential official corruption. What is even more shocking is how both the ruling and opposition parties have praised the work of party members who are serving in office, despite their having slacked off for a long time now.\u000a\u000aMinister of Health and Welfare Chiu Wen-ta (\u90b1\u6587\u9054) blamed the food safety scandals on overzealous reporting by the media. However, apart from proving that he knows nothing about democracy and the media -- unless he was deliberately trying to confuse the public by obscuring the facts -- Chiu's comments only highlight an ignorance of the system countries like the US have in place for food safety management.\u000a\u000aA few days ago, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, citing Article 15 of the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation (\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u885b\u751f\u7ba1\u7406\u6cd5), ordered that food products made using tainted oil, lard products allegedly refined with feed-oil imported from Hong Kong and other substandard oils be removed from shelves, adding that it was going to fine more than a dozen manufacturers a total of more than NT$80 million (US$2.6 million). It also said that based on Article 7, manufacturers must remove all products at their own expense, and as stated in Article 28, may be punished for false advertising.\u000a\u000aThe question is whether the aforementioned punishments are legitimate and will stand up in court. The ministry will most probably cite Article 15, Clause 7 of the food safety act, which states that: "Foods that have been adulterated or counterfeited shall not be manufactured, processed, prepared, packaged, transported, stored, sold, imported, exported, presented as a gift or publicly displayed" to sanction those found guilty of having produced or used tainted oil in their products.\u000a\u000aHowever, is this enough to cover the different types of problems caused by tainted oil?\u000a\u000aIn a legal sense, "foods that have been adulterated or counterfeited" should pertain to clearly defined content; can this be used then as a legal basis to sanction manufacturers of oils or food products that have not "been adulterated or counterfeited?" Demanding that manufacturers reclaim all products at their own expense without any external help and without any legal basis can easily give rise to debates regarding "excessive reclaims," not to mention that Article 28, which pertains to false advertising, can easily be misinterpreted and lead to debates over its interpretation.\u000a\u000aWhile the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established regulations, such as hygienic standards for edible oils, they are not the same as the standards of identity for food in the West, which mandate that each type of food or oil product sold on the market under a specific name should meet certain standards. Taiwan's legal system lacks the management laws the US Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture have had in place for many years now, and so when faced with problems caused by the modern and complex food production systems, it is hard to give clear specifications for each different type of food product and ascertain whether a contested product should be classified as one that has been adulterated or counterfeited.

VDetroit -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on Tuesday is contemplating issuing a temporary restraining order against Detroit and halt the city's controversial shut-offs of delinquent residential water accounts.\u000a\u000aAlice Jennings, attorneys for the plaintiffs who filed suit in July to stop the water shut-offs, argued in bankruptcy court Tuesday morning for a restraining order until the city improves its communication with residential customers with medical emergencies.\u000a\u000aJennings said residents with small children, elderly parents or life-threatening medical conditions face an "imminent" danger if their water is shut off.\u000a\u000a"The fear is the water could be shut off at any moment," Jennings said. "That's why we're here."\u000a\u000aDetroit attorney Timothy Fusco told the judge he would be overstepping his boundaries by telling the city how to operate its water department. Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy prohibits judges from running the city like they can when a bankrupt corporation is under their jurisdiction.\u000a\u000a"You simply cannot do it," Fusco argued.\u000a\u000aRhodes said he would issue an order Tuesday.\u000a\u000aJennings said costs for some water and sewer customers spiked starting in June of last year as the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department worked to start collecting for sewage runoff -- money that Detroit hadn't collected for years, she said.\u000a\u000a"The bills went from where people could handle to being unaffordable," Jennings said Tuesday outside of federal court. "It's not that people aren't paying; it's just that they can't pay a $300 bill."\u000a\u000aNicole Hill, 42, of Detroit, who had her water cut off in July, said she had been paying her bills. She's one of 10 people represented by Jennings and she continues to fight with the department over billing issues. Hill, a divorced mother of three children, 8, 13 and 14, said she was improperly billed for months on a previous residence. She said she continues to try to get answers over billing discrepancies and estimates she's paid almost $3,000 to the department over the past two years.\u000a\u000a"I made a great effort to pay my bill," said Hill, who had water service restored after eight weeks. "The water department is saying people aren't letting them know what's going on. But when you do, they don't do anything about it."\u000a\u000aThe utility this spring began an aggressive campaign of shut-offs of Detroit residents owing more than $150 or who were two months behind on payments. Of the 174,000 active residential accounts in Detroit, more than 74,000 are past due with bills averaging about $570.\u000a\u000aSince March, the department has shut of water to more than 19,400 residents and 157 commercial or industrial sites. More than 14,000 residents and all of the commercial and industrial accounts have had water turned back on after paying -- or making arrangements to pay -- overdue bills, according to the utility.

VConstruction has begun on a $1 billion solar power generating station in the Mohave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement Friday that since 2009, the BLM has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 25-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aA subsidiary of NextEra will own both plants.\u000a\u000aSilver State North was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government said Friday it will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business.\u000a\u000aNew proposals by the Food and Drug Administration would make it easier for farmers to meet water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA proposed the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them for four years since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say it has been a challenge to balance the need for tighter food safety standards in the wake of major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe along with the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way" and says the rules are new terrain for the agency.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between using raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without facing further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from the rules.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.

VTHOUSANDS of Victorian irrigators will soon pay less for their water and some will save thousands of dollars from their annual bills.\u000a\u000aElectricity prices have fallen as a result of the Federal Government's recent removal of the carbon tax, which guarantees water prices will drop.\u000a\u000aWater leader Jim Belbin, former chairman of the First Mildura Irrigation Trust, attacked water authorities for not acting more quickly to pass on the unprecedented savings.\u000a\u000aPower costs are a large part of the overall price of irrigation particularly where energy-hungry pumps lift water into distribution channels.\u000a\u000aThe Essential Services Commission said electricity prices made up to 15 per cent of the operating cost of water authorities.\u000a\u000aAuthorities forced to expensively pump water to their farm customers, such as Lower Murray Water in Sunraysia with almost 5000 irrigators in its pumped districts, will gain the biggest windfall. Mr Belbin said lower water bills would be welcome relief to irrigators facing lower fruit prices.\u000a\u000a"To get a price drop on irrigation bills like this is almost unprecedented," Mr Belbin said.\u000a\u000a"Because it is very, very rare is all the more reason to pass them on immediately.\u000a\u000a"There is no reason LMW cannot delay payments until they get them (new bills) right in their customers' interests."\u000a\u000aLMW acting managing director Loris Davis said the authority was still waiting on advice from its energy supplier.\u000a\u000a"We will then review the impact on our tariffs," Mrs Davis said. "Any adjustments will be in the form of a credit and it will appear on the next applicable bill."\u000a\u000aShe said she expected to receive the advice about the price impact in the next few weeks.\u000a\u000aVictorian Farmers Federation water council chairman Richard Anderson said even a few per cent saving on the bill would be welcomed by growers.\u000a\u000a"Prices seem to only go one way -- that's up -- so it will be welcome to have a bill going the other way," he said.\u000a\u000aWater prices are set years in advance by the Essential Services Commission factoring in a fixed estimate for power costs.\u000a\u000aAn ESC spokeswoman said the water authorities were allowed to pass on lower costs to customers where there had been major cost reductions.\u000a\u000aThe spokeswoman said the ESC set the maximum price that authorities could charge and it was now up to them to pass on the power cut savings.\u000a\u000a"On the carbon tax, we have written to water businesses asking them to provide us with their proposed pricing response to the repeal of clean energy legislation," the spokeswoman said.\u000a\u000a"We anticipate that businesses will announce their response to customers later in the year, and for at least some businesses, we expect that prices will be reduced."\u000a\u000aThe spokeswoman said a big swing in actual energy costs would be needed to materially affect water prices.\u000a\u000aShe said among the rural water businesses, Goulburn Murray Water had a three-year price period and low energy consumption, as did Southern Rural Water.\u000a\u000a"Lower Murray Water will be the most impacted by the carbon tax repeal and any change in energy prices, as they pump water from the Murray," the spokeswoman said.\u000a\u000aAuthorities said it was difficult to estimate how much bills would fall because volumes used by irrigators varied and power companies were still calculating the final impact.\u000a\u000aThe VFF's Mr Anderson said the final result could be a few hundred dollars for some irrigators in the non-pumped areas to thousands for big users in Victoria's north.\u000a\u000a"Any relief will be welcomed and any surprise like this is one we all like to hear," he said. "I suppose we will have to wait and watch how much it will be."

VSept. 21, 2014 -- At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40, the nine rocket engines roar to life on the Falcon launch vehicle. Image credit: NASA\u000a\u000a" Larger image\u000a\u000aA new NASA mission that will boost global monitoring of ocean winds for improved weather forecasting and climate studies is among about 5,000 pounds (2,270 kilograms) of NASA science investigations and cargo now on their way to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The cargo ship launched on the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 10:52 p.m. PDT Saturday, Sept. 20 (1:52 a.m. EDT Sunday, Sept. 21).\u000a\u000aThe SpaceX mission is the company's fourth cargo delivery flight to the space station through a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract. Dragon's cargo will support experiments to be conducted by the crews of space station Expeditions 41 and 42.\u000a\u000aThe International Space Station-Rapid Scatterometer, or ISS-RapidScat, mission will monitor ocean winds from the vantage point of the space station. This space-based scatterometer, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, is a remote sensing instrument that uses radar pulses reflected from the ocean's surface from different angles to calculate surface wind speed and direction. This information will be useful for weather and marine forecasting and hurricane monitoring.\u000a\u000aISS-RapidScat's berth on the space station will put it in an orbit that is unique from any other wind measuring instrument currently in orbit. This vantage point will give scientists the first near-global direct observations of how ocean winds vary over the course of the day due to solar heating. The new mission will also provide cross-calibration of the international constellation of ocean wind satellites, extending the continuity and usefulness of the scatterometer data record.\u000a\u000aApproximately nine days after berthing with the station, the RapidScat instrument and its nadir adapter, which orients the instrument to point down at Earth, will be robotically installed on the External Payload Facility SDX site of the Columbus module over a three-day period by the station's robotic arm, which is controlled by ground controllers at NASA's Johnson Space Center. ISS-RapidScat is an autonomous payload, requiring no interaction from station astronauts.\u000a\u000aUsing a different end effector -- a mechanical hand -- the station's robotic arm will first extract RapidScat's nadir adapter from the trunk of the Dragon and install it on an external site on the Columbus module. The arm will then pluck the RapidScat instrument assembly from the Dragon's trunk and attach it to the nadir adapter, completing the installation. Each of the two operations will take about six hours.\u000a\u000aOnce installed, RapidScat will be activated over a period of three days. Checkout of RapidScat will be completed approximately two weeks after installation. About two weeks of preliminary calibration and validation will then follow. RapidScat will then be ready to begin its two-year science mission.\u000a\u000aDragon also will deliver the first-ever 3-D printer in space. The technology enables parts to be manufactured quickly and cheaply in space, instead of waiting for the next cargo resupply vehicle delivery. The research team also will gain valuable insight into improving 3-D printing technology on Earth by demonstrating it in microgravity.\u000a\u000aNew biomedical hardware launched aboard the spacecraft will help facilitate prolonged biological studies in microgravity. The Rodent Research Hardware and Operations Validation (Rodent Research-1) investigation provides a platform for long-duration rodent experiments in space. These investigations examine how microgravity affects animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may have direct impact toward human health on Earth.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spacecraft will also transport other biological research, including a new plant study. The Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware has supported a variety of plant growth experiments aboard the space station. The BRIC-19 investigation will focus on the growth and development in microgravity of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a small flowering plant related to cabbage. Because plant development on Earth is impacted by mechanical forces such as wind or a plant's own weight, researchers hope to improve understanding of how the growth responses of plants are altered by the absence of these forces when grown in microgravity.\u000a\u000aDragon is scheduled to be grappled at 4:04 a.m. PDT (7:04 a.m. EDT) on Tuesday, Sept. 23, by Expedition 41 Flight Engineer Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, using the space station's robotic arm to take hold of the spacecraft. NASA's Reid Wiseman will support Gerst in a backup position. Dragon is scheduled to depart the space station in mid-October for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja California, bringing from the space station almost 3,200 pounds (1,450 kilograms) of science, hardware and crew supplies.\u000a\u000aThe space station is a convergence of science, technology and human innovation that demonstrates new technologies and makes research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. NASA recently awarded contracts to SpaceX and The Boeing Company to transport U.S. crews to and from the space station with the goal of certifying those transportation systems in 2017.\u000a\u000aISS-RapidScat is a partnership between JPL and the International Space Station Program Office at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, with support from the Earth Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. Other mission partners include the Kennedy Space Center, Florida; NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama; the European Space Agency; and SpaceX.\u000a\u000aFor more information about SpaceX's fourth cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, visit:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nasa.gov/spacex\u000a\u000aFor more information about the International Space Station, visit:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nasa.gov/station\u000a\u000aFor more information on Earth science activities aboard the space station, visit:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nasa.gov/issearthscience\u000a\u000aISS-RapidScat is the third of five NASA Earth science missions scheduled to launch into space within 12 months, the most new Earth-observing mission launches in one year in more than a decade. NASA monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing. The agency shares this unique knowledge with the global community and works with institutions in the United States and around the world that contribute to understanding and protecting our home planet.\u000a\u000aFor more information about NASA's Earth science activities in 2014, visit:

VSalt water covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, making it one of the most abundant and under-appreciated resources on the planet. Taking advantage of this resource, Nanoflowcell has developed the world's first saltwater-powered electric car! The vehicle, known as the Quant e-Sportlimousine, can accelerate from 0-62MPH in an impressive 2.8 seconds, and it just received approval for testing in Europe. In other green transportation news, designer Dominic Wilcox just unveiled a self-driving car with a bed inside -- so you can catch up on sleep while you commute to work! The real kicker? It's made from gorgeous panels of stained glass.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Arizona-based company Local Motors built the world's first 3D-printed car at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. The car is made up of about 40 components (far fewer than the thousands of parts that go into a typical car), and it was printed and assembled in 44 hours. And if you've ever dreamt of keeping up with the fastest humans in history, DARPA has created a jetpack that can help you run a four-minute mile. The jetpack contains small turbines that propel its wearer forward, and it's intended to help soldiers who are weighed down with lots of equipment and gear, but are expected to move quickly over long distances.\u000a\u000aMany homes these days are powered by solar panels, but few are powered by the ocean. Architect Margot Krasojevi\u0107 just unveiled designs for a futuristic hydroelectric house that is shaped like a spiky sea urchin. The tidal-powered home features an electromagnetic turbine system that uses neodymium magnets and copper wire coils to induce an electric current when the waves push and pull against the extruded chambers. In other clean energy news, Wildpoldsried, a Bavarian village of about 2,600 residents, produces 500 percent more energy than it needs from renewable sources. The tiny town makes a profit by selling the surplus power back to the grid. The NYC-based tech startup Volta Group has just installed its first EnGo public charging station, which powers mobile devices with a clean energy combo of kinetic tiles and solar panels in St. Louis. And speaking of photovoltaic panels, we just published a fun DIY that shows how to make your own solar power generator! The rise of wind energy is one of the biggest clean tech success stories of recent years, but animal lovers and conservationists worry that turbines are a major contributor to bird deaths. A massive study supported by the American Wind Wildlife Institute sheds some light on the situation -- wind turbines account for 214,000 to 368,000 bird deaths each year, while radio and cell tower collisions kill 6.8 million and cats kill up to 3.7 billion.\u000a\u000aBuildings account for about 40 percent of US energy consumption, but new green building techniques are looking to make a dent in that. One super-efficient passive house in Wisconsin is able to stay warm using less energy than a typical hair dryer -- and that's especially important in a part of the country where it can get as cold as 30 degrees below zero in the winter. Another way to cut down on energy use is to just build smaller. A team of Chinese students recently unveiled a 43-square-foot house that fits a bed, a kitchen, a bathroom and storage space. The house will be made from prefabricated materials and mass-produced to provide affordable housing for cash-strapped students, migrant workers or even the homeless. And to achieve maximum relaxation while spending time in the outdoors, nothing beats a tree tent. A UK-based husband-and-wife team recently unveiled a set of colorful tree tents that look like a cross between a hammock, a tepee tent and a tiny tree house. In the world of interior design, 3D printing is starting to make its mark: The German company LimeMakers just unveiled a new line of 3D-printed products at this year's London Design Festival, including a fruit bowl, geometric lamps and vases. UK furniture designer Paul Kelley just unveiled magnetic modular furniture made from copper-clad cubes that be can reassembled in dozens of configurations. And if you think your office is a rat race, we've got the perfect desk for you: A giant human hamster wheel!

VToday, when the Department of Interior and the California Department of Natural Resources released a draft of the long-awaited Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP), the agencies set the stage for a first-of-its-kind project -- in more ways than one. Not only does the DRECP have the potential to serve as a blueprint for conservation and clean energy development in the California desert, it could become a model for how federal, state, and local agencies can work together ... and how those collaborations are better overall for everyone involved.\u000a\u000aThe DRECP is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between the Bureau of Land Management, the California Energy Commission, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to plan for conservation and renewable energy development across 22 million acres of private and public lands. And it's the result of a public process that NRDC, fellow conservation groups, renewable energy companies and many other stakeholders have been engaged in for more than four years.\u000a\u000aBut what people might not know is that the framework for the DRECP was developed with a number of "smart from the start" planning hallmarks that NRDC has advocated for years now, including:\u000a\u000aNRDC has long believed that land management and permitting agencies should guide renewable energy development to areas with low environmental and wildlife risk, high energy potential, and close proximity to necessary infrastructure like transmission. Planning efforts like the DRECP, if designed and implemented correctly, can help achieve these goals.\u000a\u000aJust as important, "smart from the start" planning must also identify areas that should be set aside because they are too ecologically valuable to be developed. And the planning process must also include mitigation measures that will result in the lasting protection and conservation of wildlife and sensitive areas.\u000a\u000aDesert Conservation Opportunities\u000a\u000aThe DRECP presents a unique opportunity to build a strategic conservation reserve with lasting and meaningful protections for some of the desert's most imperiled species and special landscapes. It also offers a chance to help protect important wildlife corridors that will be critical in the face of climate change. As we review the DRECP we will be looking for strong, science-based strategies for realizing these important conservation opportunities.\u000a\u000aFighting Climate Change\u000a\u000aAs I get ready to review the draft document, it's my hope that the DRECP will be the roadmap we need to preserve the desert's special places and species and provide a balanced approach to large scale renewable energy development -- wind, solar, and geothermal on both private and public lands. As we move forward with pursuing our climate goals as aggressively as we can, it's important to use all the tools at our disposal -- the DRECP is one piece of a comprehensive plan to fight climate change that includes energy efficiency, conservation, distributed generation, and modernizing our electric grid to handle more renewables from both sides of the meter.\u000a\u000aWhat Happens Next?\u000a\u000aIt is critical that the upcoming comment period for the DRECP include a robust, open, and transparent public process for all stakeholders so that the final plan reflects the values and needs of diverse constituencies. We understand that once the draft plan is released, 11 workshops will be held to solicit feedback. People will also be able to submit written comments for 90 days. More information on future workshops and how to submit written comments will be posted on the official DRECP website.\u000a\u000aGiven that the draft EIS is expected to total as many as 12,000 pages, it will take some time to closely review the plan and all its components. NRDC will work with our partners to provide the most detailed and thoughtful comments we can on this landmark document, and we are hopeful that draft plan will point us in the right direction for developing the lasting framework that we need for balancing our clean energy and natural resource protection goals in the desert.

VInventHelp, a leading inventor service firm, is submitting the Archery Boresighter to applicable companies for their review.\u000a\u000a"In order to sight a bow, you normally have to loose several arrows," said an inventor from Mc Gill, Nev. "This not only wears out the cables, it also puts you at risk of losing expensive shafts and heads. To make it easier to sight in a bow, I came up with this alternative method."\u000a\u000aHe developed the patent-pending ARCHERY BORESIGHTER to offer a more convenient way to adjust the sight on a bow. The unit eliminates the need to fire the weapon repeatedly. This saves time and effort. It also reduces wear and tear on the cables, and minimizes the risk of losing arrows in the field. Furthermore, the invention ensures that the bow fires accurately when hunting game.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp.

VThe federal government is attempting to overhaul the way we dispose of radioactive waste, but it doesn't have a place to store the used nuclear fuel quite yet. The U.S. Department of Energy has plans for an interim storage site by 2021 and a permanent site by 2048, but no location for either site has been confirmed. The Obama administration is pushing a new plan to use special rail cars to haul the 150-ton casks of waste. Idustry officials argue it's not a bad idea to start transportation planning, despite the lack of specific locale details. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car," said Everett Redmond of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

VFirst 3-D printer sent to ISS along with mice. The launch was successful on Sunday after being aborted first.\u000a\u000aCRS-4 of the SpaceX commercial resupply services to the International Space Station was expected to be launched. Everything was in order. But at the last minute the take off of the SpaceX launch had to be aborted due to bad weather, according to US space-agency NASA. It has been reported that the weather conditions deteriorating the mission now has been delayed until Sunday. Had everything gone as expected then the launch date was Saturday for the Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\u000a\u000aDespite this setback, it is understood that things will be back in order as the launch now has been rescheduled for Sunday at 1:52 a.m. EDT. But a lot will depend on the weather.\u000a\u000aProviding reasons for the delayed launch, NASA issued a statement in which it claimed: "Because of weather conditions that violated the rules for launching, SpaceX has postponed its planned launch of its Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft. It is SpaceX's fourth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station."\u000a\u000aThe take off the Dragon spacecraft is important. It is slated to carry with it 4,885 pounds of cargo, including 1,380 pounds of crew supplies. Besides these items, the spacecraft will be loaded with other equipments like science experiments, technology demonstrations and the International Space Station Rapid Scatterometer, or ISS-RapidScat.\u000a\u000aMore details are available about the 3D printer that has been sent to the ISS. A report while talking about it says, "The space station-bound 3-D printer was developed by Made in Space, another California company. It's sturdier than Earthly models to withstand the stresses of launch, and meets NASA's strict safety standards. The space agency envisions astronauts one day cranking out spare parts as needed. For now, it's a technology demonstrator, with a bigger and better model to follow next year"

VGovernment plans on having an interim nuclear test storage site in place in the year 2021, and to have a long term geologic depository in the year 2048.\u000a\u000aWith the plans of the current Obama administration to have an interim test storage site in the year 2021 and to have a long term geologic depository in the year 2048, the government has been looking for opinions on how rail cars should be obtained to carry radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street OTC reported on Aug. 31 that the Obama administration is already thinking about the contracts for developing, testing as well as certifying the necessary rail equipment that would carry the radioactive nuclear fuel. In a public solicitation by the government, opinions were asked for whether the rail cars should be brought or leased. Companies were asked for ideas on how rail cars should be obtained for hauling 150-ton casks that are filled with radioactive nuclear fuel. The cars are expected to last for 30 years and on regular tracks, they would run at standard speeds.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street OTC reported that officials of the U.S. Energy Department didn't respond to messages that sought detailed comments. The responsibility of regulating shipments is shared by Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation. Senior Scientist at Geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc., James Conca says that it is necessary for lining up transportation options. He said a nuclear waste disposal site has been monitored by him.\u000a\u000aTrain cars have to be buffered so that a safe distance is maintained between the radioactive cargo and a crew. Fuel is already being sent by U.S. military by rail from reactors on navy ships for storage to federal labs. More than 2,300 tons was hauled by the civilian power industry from the year 1979 to the year 2007. Nuclear fuel is very radioactive and hot when removed from reactors.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration hasn't given any indications about where the actual nuclear depository and test sites would be located.

VThe government said Friday it will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business.\u000a\u000aNew proposals by the Food and Drug Administration would make it easier for farmers to meet water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA proposed the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them for four years since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say it has been a challenge to balance the need for tighter food safety standards in the wake of major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe along with the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way" and says the rules are new terrain for the agency.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between using raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without facing further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from the rules.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.

VCarrying groundbreaking cargo, the SpaceX Dragon launched from the Kennedy Space Center on Sunday. The spacecraft is transporting a 3-D printer to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000a"It marks the first time a 3-D printer will be used in space, testing the ability to produce parts cheaply and on demand instead of waiting for them to arrive on a cargo ship. This technology would save time and money in future deep space missions," CNN reports. "Also coming along is a device called ISS-RapidScat that will measure the winds on the Earth's oceans."\u000a\u000aAccording to CNN, "It will arrive on Tuesday, bringing other cargo as well, including 20 mice and elements for 255 scientific experiments aboard the ISS." This is the fourth cargo flight for the Dragon, including its May 2012 test flight.\u000a\u000aThree new crew members will join the International Space Station on Sept. 25.\u000a\u000aNASA recently contracted SpaceX and Boeing to resume U.S. human spaceflght with the development of space taxis. The hope is that this will eventually end our country's reliance on Russia -- costing $70 million per seat -- for transportation.\u000a\u000aBoth private companies will design crafts and undergo safety testing before manned flights are booked. Once certified, each company will launched an estimated two to six missions.\u000a\u000aBoeing is set to build three of its CST-100 -- seven passenger -- crafts at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Space X will build its first passenger craft, since its existing SpaceX Dragon delivers only cargo to the space station currently. Space X Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft for cargo in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe contracts with NASA are worth $6.8 billion. Boeing has the larger share with $4.2 billion, and Space X receives $2.6 billion.

VPORTLAND, Ore. >> In a TV ad paid for by advocates of labeling genetically modified foods in Oregon, voters are told 64 countries have such requirements and labels didn't lead to an increase in their food costs.\u000a\u000aOpponents of GMO labeling have released an ad that says the opposite: Labels would be costly for food producers and consumers and would not show which ingredients in a product are modified.\u000a\u000aWith a decision on the Nov. 4 ballot measure just five weeks away, the two opposing camps combined have reported contributions of nearly $3 million and expenditures of more than $2 million, including advertising. It's a sign of what's still to come.\u000a\u000aThis is round three in the GMO labeling match in recent years. Similar measures in California and in Washington state failed narrowly after millions of dollars were spent, mostly by labeling opponents.\u000a\u000aIf adopted, the initiative by Oregon GMO Right to Know would require manufacturers, retailers and suppliers to label raw and packaged foods produced entirely or partially by genetic engineering. The measure would not apply to animal feed or food served in restaurants. It would be effective January 2016.\u000a\u000aThe Unites States does not require labeling of genetically engineered foods. Three states -- Vermont, Maine and Connecticut -- have passed labeling laws, although they don't take effect immediately. A similar measure also recently qualified for the ballot in Colorado.\u000a\u000aLabeling supporters say there aren't enough studies on the impacts of GMOs, so consumers have a right to know if they are eating them. Gov. John Kitzhaber, who is running for re-election, recently came out in support of the measure, as did Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.\u000a\u000aCritics say mandatory labels would mislead consumers into thinking that engineered ingredients are unsafe, which scientists have not proven. As in previous cases, the anti-labeling campaign is chiefly financed by out-of-state food corporations and biotech companies that grow engineered crops; endorsers include large state farming groups.\u000a\u000aThough it's not reflected in the early filings, opponents are expected to raise a lot more money than proponents.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling campaign in Oregon has thus far reported just over $1 million in cash and in-kind contributions and has reported spending about half a million, according to filings with the Oregon Secretary of State's office.\u000a\u000aThe pro-labeling campaign shows $1.9 million in contributions and expenditures of $1.6 million.\u000a\u000aThese donations and expenditures are from a month ago because the campaigns have 30 days to make reports.\u000a\u000aIn both California and Washington state, biotech and other giant food companies vastly outspent opponents -- a factor most experts agree helped defeat those measures. In both cases, the measures were defeated by about 2 percentage points.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling campaign spent about $45.6 million in California, compared to $8.7 million by labeling supporters. In Washington state, where the ballot contest went on record as the costliest in state history, opponents spent $33.3 million, compared to $9.8 million collected by the pro-labeling groups.\u000a\u000aIn Oregon, the labeling issue isn't new. In 2002, voters soundly defeated a GMO labeling measure. But the attention to GMO's has grown since then, as has opposition to genetically engineered crops in Oregon.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, voters in two rural, conservative counties in southern Oregon -- Jackson and Josephine -- approved bans on GMO crops. The vote came on the heels of the discovery of a patch of GMO wheat in Eastern Oregon. That discovery led to Japan and South Korea suspending imports of the crop over GMO concerns, temporarily closing a $700 million market and causing outcry and concern among farmers.\u000a\u000aLabeling proponents say that could help turn the tide in Oregon. Ads released by both sides feature Oregon farmers, a tell-tale sign of their importance to the measure's fate.\u000a\u000aSupporters say labels would help family farmers by "letting people know the difference between the traditional food we grow and food genetically engineered in a lab." Opponents say labels would hurt farmers, because "the last thing we need is a bunch of complex, costly regulations that don't exist in any other states."\u000a\u000aLabeling proponents also say they've learned from pro-labeling campaigns in California and Washington.\u000a\u000a"We've tightened the language in Measure 92 so the opposition can't make the same misleading claims they did in both those states," including making clear that labeling applies only to food meant for human consumption and increasing protections for farmers, campaign spokesman Kevin Glenn said.\u000a\u000aThe campaign is also focusing more on knocking on doors and registering new voters, Glenn said. The approach seems to be working: The coalition has received donations from nearly 3,000 Oregon donors. Its extensive list of endorsements includes nearly 100 farms and farming organizations, as well as dozens of restaurants, grocers, chefs and other groups.\u000a\u000aOpponents call the measure badly written. It would not, for example, require labels for meat and dairy products from animals fed genetically engineered feed. They also say consumers who wish to avoid GMOs already have the choice to buy organic foods.\u000a\u000a"This measure provides inaccurate and misleading information, and doesn't tell consumers what's in the food," said Dana Bieber, spokeswoman for the Vote NO on 92 Coalition.\u000a\u000aThe anti-labeling side has not released a full list of endorsers.

VThe plan -- covering 22 million acres of public and private land -- follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's Mojave desert during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers siting sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday would designate a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted. Jewell's release Tuesday opened the plan for several months of public comment.\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Conservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species. The plant also proved unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be. "There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat. "The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VFounded in 1984, InventHelp is attempting to submit the Clean Paw to applicable companies for their review.\u000a\u000a"While my wife was pregnant it was difficult for her to wipe our dog's paws when he came in from outside," said an inventor from Ozone Park, N.Y., "so we designed an easier way to make sure that pets' paws are clean."\u000a\u000aThe patent-pending CLEAN PAW helps prevent a pet from tracking dirt on a floor after coming in from outside. This avoids messes and the need for cleanup. It also eliminates the need to bend over or kneel to clean the paws manually, which saves time and effort. In addition, it reduces risk of roundworm infection and removes pesticides, herbicides, grass, pollen, molds, dust mites, etc. The device is easy to use and producible in design variations.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Long Island office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

VMore than half the land lies within San Bernardino County. The rest is distributed among six other southeastern counties.\u000a\u000aJewell remarked:\u000a\u000a"So commonly we look across landscapes like this and think that there's nothing there. But there are a number of species that live just in this place. We now have a roadmap that can be used in other areas across the country to say these are the areas with the greatest potential and the least conflict for development and these are the areas that should never be developed."\u000a\u000aThe sweeping Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan Jewell unveiled -- 8,000 pages long -- proposes streamlining 2 million acres as land immediately available for 20,000 Mw of utility-scale solar, wind, and geothermal projects during the next 25 years, and designating another 4.9 million acres for conservation of desert habitat and animals. The energy component would more than double the current energy production from California desert renewables.\u000a\u000aThe plan culminates five years of consultation between conservationists, scientists, developers, native American tribes, state and federal energy and wildlife officials, and others. SFGate reports:\u000a\u000a"The goal is to prevent some of the mistakes that were made during the 'solar gold rush' in the Mojave Desert during the first year of the Obama administration, when solar developers, backed by billions in federal stimulus money, put giant industrial facilities on relatively undisturbed public lands in an effort to combat climate change and wean the country from fossil fuels."\u000a\u000aThe California Energy Commission, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are the lead agencies (Renewable Energy Action Team) for the California desert renewables/conservation plan. The plan iterates renewable energy, biological, and legal/regulatory goals and includes a Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement. It defines four DRECP "action alternatives" and the no action alternative.\u000a\u000aHere are the characteristics of the preferred alternative:\u000a\u000aIn the staff blog of the Natural Resources Defense Council, contributor Helen O'Shea praises the multi-agency effort:\u000a\u000a"Not only does the DRECP have the potential to serve as a blueprint for conservation and clean energy development in the California desert, it could become a model for how federal, state, and local agencies can work together ... and how those collaborations are better overall for everyone involved."\u000a\u000aNow that the plan for California desert renewables has been released, a period of public comment begins on Friday and continues until January 9. The proposal has already divided conservationists and renewable energy activists in this region. The authors of the plan defend its broad-brush approach as presenting "conservation benefits that could not be achieved using the project-by-project approach currently used to permit renewable energy projects and protect species."\u000a\u000aThose who object to the plan point to the unanticipated effects of the $2.2 billion Ivanpah concentrating solar plant, opened in January near the Nevada border, on threatened desert tortoises and a fraction of the bird population. Illustrating the depth of debate is the fact that Ivanpah also received POWER Magazine's first Plant of the Year award for renewables in the award's 40-year history.\u000a\u000aDesert residents have opined that the Obama administration should focus less on large-scale plants and more on rooftop solar. Native American tribes and people and the U.S. military also have a stake in what happens regarding California desert renewables. Areas of special interest and possible contention include the 23-square-mile solar and wind facility plant by Iberdola Renewables in the remote, near-pristine Silurian Valley near the Death Valley park and the 3,000-acre solar facility at Soda Mountain near the Mojave National Preserve.\u000a\u000aUnlike traditional environmental impact statements, the plan for California desert renewables considers the effects of possible climate change. The renewable projects presented should offer significant pluses in this category that may offset other effects deemed environmentally undesirable.\u000a\u000aYou can access the digital documents comprising the draft plan and environmental reports from the California Energy Commission website. They are also available at available at local area libraries and on DVD upon request.

VLOS ANGELES -- Four companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind energy generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling project -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms 40 miles north of Cheyenne, a huge energy storage site inside caverns in a Utah salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe power -- potentially twice the amount produced by the 1930s-era dam, enough to serve 1.3 million people annually -- would be sent on to California through an existing 490-mile line.\u000a\u000aIt's success hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aThe California agency, anchored to 11 municipal utilities, delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers. It's seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy and power storage. Agency officials did not immediately return a call for comment.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to burning coal for electricity. The proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boom to the sleepy ranching town of 216 nestled below beige sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest under development in the U.S. is a 1,000-turbine site planned by Denver-based The Anschutz Corp. near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost -- the government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year after flying into wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the companies' plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars has been invested in wind and solar projects. But finding an economical way to store energy has been a key issue given the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind or sun. Under the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using four caverns carved out of underground salt formations, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aWhen energy demand is low, excess electricity from the wind farm would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators, the statement said.\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VATLANTA (AP) - The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VCommercial space travel took a big leap this week after the U.S. space agency NASA awarded a combined $6.8 billion to Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to build commercially owned and operated "space taxis" to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The NASA contract allows Boeing to sell rides to tourists; SpaceX already planned to offer trips to tourists, but did not say if it would fly tourists on its NASA missions .\u000a\u000a"We're starting to look at (suborbital space travel) more closely," said a representative on the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) governing council who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aMontreal-based ICAO will hold its first conference on issues related to commercial space travel in early 2015 and will discuss whether it should expand its governance to include oversight of suborbital space travel.\u000a\u000aICAO has come under criticism for not warning of the risks to commercial aircraft over conflict zones after a Malaysian airline was downed over eastern Ukraine in July, killing all 298 people aboard. The 191-member agency is not responsible for opening or closing airspace, a task left to individual states.\u000a\u000aIndustry experts said ICAO, which promotes the development of global civil aviation including air transport standards, should play a role in planning for the retrieval of space debris, for instance, at a time when private enterprise is eyeing the final frontier.\u000a\u000a"People have just begun to think about it, but how it is to be instituted is not clear yet," said Prashant Sukul, India's representative on ICAO's governing council. "If it's not ICAO, then who is it going to be?"\u000a\u000aSukul, one of a handful of representatives hoping to replace retiring secretary general Raymond Benjamin in 2015, said he is campaigning on a "space platform."\u000a\u000aDiscussion aimed at broadening ICAO's mandate is in initial stages and could take years to apply. Sukul acknowledged the challenge space represents for an agency that can take years to tackle key issues on Earth.\u000a\u000aAfter a Korean airliner was shot down in 1983 by the Soviet Union, it took 15 years for an amendment to be added to ICAO's founding articles - the Chicago convention - that said states should not shoot down civilian airliners.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Allison Lampert; Editing by Amran Abocar and Leslie Adler)

VWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VFour energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam that produces enough power for 1.3 million people annually. It calls for construction of an expansive wind farm 40 miles north of Cheyenne and a massive energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aSuccess hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be completing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, which delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VLas Vegas: Construction has begun on a $1 billion (Dh3.67 billion) solar power generating station in the Mohave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement Friday that since 2009, the BLM has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aLarge scale\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 25-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aA subsidiary of NextEra will own both plants.\u000a\u000aSilver State North was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stands fueled for blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a space station resupply mission, but stormy weather forced a 24-hour delay&nbsp;Sept. 20, 2014. NASA TV\u000a\u000aThick clouds and rain over central Florida early Saturday forced SpaceX to order a 24-hour delay for the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a Dragon supply ship bound for the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aCompany engineers at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station plan to make another attempt to get the commercial resupply mission off the ground at 1:52 a.m. EDT Sunday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries Launch Complex 40 into the plane of the space station's orbit.\u000a\u000aForecasters are predicting just a 40 percent chance of acceptable weather Sunday. Assuming the launch goes forward, the Dragon cargo ship atop the Falcon 9 rocket will reach the International Space Station early Tuesday, bringing more than 5,100 pounds of equipment and supplies to the lab's crew.\u000a\u000aA third launch opportunity may be possible Tuesday if the Falcon 9 can't get off Sunday. But after that, SpaceX would have to stand down until Sept. 28 to make way for the launch of a Russian Soyuz ferry craft Sept. 25 carrying three station crew members.\u000a\u000aSpaceX holds a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for 12 Falcon 9/Dragon flights to the station to deliver some 44,000 pounds of cargo. Orbital Sciences Corp. holds a $1.9 billion contract covering eight missions and 40,000 pounds of supplies and equipment. Both contracts were awarded as part of an effort to make up for the cargo capability lost with the space shuttle's retirement.

VThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VInventHelp, a Pittsburgh-based inventor service company, is attempting to submit the C.I.A. (Coach's Instructional Aid) to companies for their review and possible evaluation.\u000a\u000aIf a team's plays are known by the other team ahead of time, the planning of the plays was all in vain, so an inventor from Picayune, Miss., has created a solution to this problem. "After observing coaches covering up their mouths with their hands or play cards, I decided that there needed to be a better way to do this," she said. "God inspired me with an idea."\u000a\u000aThe patent-pending C.I.A. (COACH'S INSTRUCTIONAL AID) prevents a coach's lips from being read by coaches and members of the opposing team and professional lip readers. This maintains secrecy of plays, as well as promotes convenience and peace of mind. Easy to use and producible in design variations, the invention is ideal for coaches of most sports.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Mobile office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

VLOS ANGELES -- The push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement.

VATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VHOUSTON, Sept. 5, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The International Space Station Program Science Office has announced the award recipients for the International Space Station Post-Graduate Innovation Awards in Space Life and Physical Science Research opportunity. The NASA Research Announcement was targeted at reaching graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who were already starting a career as science researchers in the Life and Physical Sciences disciplines. Proposals included innovative ideas for microgravity research specifically in the areas of physical sciences, microbiology and space physiology.\u000a\u000aRecipients are eligible for awards up to $4,000, which will allow them to submit a full space station research flight proposal. One of these proposals may also be eligible for full funding for a flight to the space station. Awardees were chosen using criteria that included the significance of the study, the approach's design and methods, level of innovation, the qualifications of the investigators and the appropriateness of the scientific environment.\u000a\u000a"This NASA research announcement reaches out to a new and specific group of graduate students and fellows because we don't know what else is out there in terms of innovative investigation ideas for the space station," said Camille Alleyne, space station assistant program scientist. "It is a deliberate effort to get people involved in space station science. With opportunities like these, we are growing the next generation of space researchers."\u000a\u000aThe recipients for this set of awards are:\u000a\u000aJosh Colwell with the University of Central Florida for the project Behavior of Regolith in Microgravity Environments on Asteroids and Planetary Satellites. This concept investigates regolith motion in reduced-gravity environments, specifically looking at the low behavior of granular material along slopes (landslides and avalanches) under reduced-gravity conditions; and the displacement of granular matter in response to impact-induced seismic vibrations. Jae-Hoon Chung with the Ohio State University for the project Effect of Spaceflight on Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes with Arrhythmogenic Mutation. Microgravity is known to cause various changes in the cardiovascular system such as reduced arterial pressure and heart rate. This concept proposes a study of the biological mechanism of microgravity-induced arrhythmias in a controlled in vitro model. Paul Steen with Cornell University for the project Inferring Contact-line Mobility by Observing Coalescence Dynamics. This concept seeks to understand contact-line (CL) mobility in drops that are undergoing coalescence on a solid surface. The results of this investigation can possibly enable longer duration missions to Mars and beyond, by potentially enabling high heat transfer rates in a low mass system that requires no external energy to remove drops. Thomas Avedisian with Cornell University for the project Development of an Algae Biodiesel Surrogate from Spherically Symmetric Droplet Combustion Experiments on the International Space Station. This concept studies the ignition and burning characteristics of algal biodiesel droplets and its relationship to a surrogate derived from the major constituents of the biodiesel. The algal biodiesel is used as an alternative/renewable fuel source for combustion engines. Yiguang Ju with the Trustees of Princeton University for the project Study of Cool Flames with Ozone Sensitization in Microgravity. The concept presented is a novel method for using plasma-generated ozone to establish stable cool diffusion and premixed flames in a microgravity field so that cool flame dynamics, structure, and chemistry can be studied and understood in an ideal environment. This can lead to a higher energy efficiency of high performing engines.\u000a\u000aNASA is trying to attract young researchers who have not previously considered conducting scientific investigations in space. The agency encourages new investigators to consider how their studies on the ground may translate to, and perhaps benefit considerably from, the microgravity environment.\u000a\u000aFor additional information about EPSCOR, visit:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/epscpr\u000a\u000aLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\u000a\u000aSOURCE NASA\u000a\u000aCopyright (C) 2014 PR Newswire.

VThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced more than $8 million for microgrid projects. The department says the investment, which includes seven awardees, will support the development of advanced technologies to allow communities across the country to better prepare for potential grid disruptions.\u000a\u000a"Building in grid resiliency has gained greater urgency in recent years, as demonstrated by the economic and personal losses from electricity outages due to severe weather," says Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. "Keeping the power on during extreme weather events and other electric grid disruptions is essential, particularly so that critical facilities such as hospitals and water treatment plants can continue operating."\u000a\u000aThe DOE says the projects will bring together communities, technology developers and providers, and utilities to develop advanced microgrid controllers and system designs for microgrids less than 10 MW. Each project also includes a company cost share ranging from 20% to about 50%. The seven awards include the following:\u000a\u000aALSTOM Grid Inc. - DOE investment approximately $1.2 million\u000a\u000aLocated in Redmond, Wash., ALSTOM Grid will research and design community microgrid systems for Philadelphia Industrial Development Corp. and the Philadelphia Water Department, using portions of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard as a test bed.\u000a\u000aBurr Energy LLC - DOE investment approximately $1.2 million\u000a\u000aHeadquartered in Little Falls, Minn., Burr Energy will design and build a resilient microgrid to allow the Olney, Md., Town Center to function normally as a "lights-on" district for weeks in the event of a regional outage. A second microgrid will be designed for multi-use commercial development in nearby Prince George's County, Md.\u000a\u000aCommonwealth Edison (ComEd) - DOE investment approximately $1.2 million\u000a\u000aHeadquartered in Chicago, ComEd will develop and test a commercial-grade microgrid controller capable of controlling a system of two or more interconnected microgrids. The project includes a diverse mix of facilities and critical loads, including police and fire department headquarters, major transportation infrastructure, healthcare facilities for seniors, and private residences.\u000a\u000aElectric Power Research Institute (EPRI) - DOE investment approximately $1.2 million\u000a\u000aLocated in Knoxville, Tenn., EPRI will develop a commercially viable, standardized microgrid controller that can allow a community to provide continuous power for critical loads. The DOE says standardizing functionality will ensure that the controller can be easily adapted for a wide range of electric grid characteristics and allow grid operators to leverage distribution assets to support both islanded and grid-connected operation.\u000a\u000aGeneral Electric (GE) - DOE investment approximately $1.2 million\u000a\u000aBased in Niskayuna, N.Y., GE Global Research will develop an enhanced microgrid control system by adding new capabilities, such as frequency regulation.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) -- An alliance of four companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aIf approved and financed, the sprawling venture would produce clean power equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant by creating one of the country's largest wind farms near Cheyenne, a huge energy storage site inside Utah caverns and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, described it as "the 21st century's Hoover Dam," referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama pressed world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a one-day United Nations summit aimed to gather support for a climate change treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam. Success hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," Miller, the analyst, said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VATLANTA -- A plan by Georgia Power to change the way it pays for solar electricity from small- and medium-sized projects is worrying developers just a year after they pushed the monopoly into using more renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThis price dispute illustrates the tension between traditional utility companies and a growing solar industry. For years, the Southern Co. subsidiary has operated on a straightforward monopoly model: Use a small number of big, expensive plants to produce huge amounts of electricity relatively cheaply. In the long run, distributed solar panels could make those big plants less important and weaken the financial clout of traditional utilities.\u000a\u000aThe latest conflict focuses on how much Georgia Power should pay developers who build small- and medium-sized solar projects. Right now, those projects compete in a lottery to sell their energy to Georgia Power at a fixed cost of 13 cents per kilowatt hour. That price is supposed to reflect how much it would cost the utility to produce an equivalent amount of power using its own equipment.\u000a\u000aNow Georgia Power wants to abandon the lottery and buy energy from solar developers who offer the cheapest prices.\u000a\u000a"It is time to let the market deliver the best value to our customers," the company said in a legal filing.\u000a\u000aIn theory, cheap solar energy should benefit Georgia Power customers. However, some developers worry that small customers and investors will hesitate to build solar panels if uncertain or fluctuating prices make it difficult to predict a project's financial payoff. The industry also says the price Georgia Power pays fails to reflect other benefits for society, for example, less pollution from burning fossil fuels.\u000a\u000a"It's very destructive to companies that in the past have based their business decisions knowing they have a certain rate to rely on," said Brion Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Georgia Solar Energy Association.\u000a\u000aGeorgia Power officials agreed to delay its plan until the issue can be discussed further. A meeting has been set for Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"We're going to move cautiously and slow and in the interest of the consumer," said PSC Commissioner Lauren "Bubba" McDonald, who pushed the utility to expand its solar power usage.\u000a\u000aA year ago, a coalition of solar companies, trade groups and anti-monopoly tea party activists successfully lobbied regulators to force Georgia Power to add another 525 megawatts of solar electricity to its system. Initially, the utility did not propose adding new solar projects in its plans for meeting the state's energy needs for the next 20 years. When it became clear that solar proponents had the votes, Georgia Power opted not to resist.\u000a\u000aIn July, the Georgia Solar Energy Industries Association asked regulators to consider raising the price Georgia Power pays for solar electricity. The trade group said the price should reflect additional factors since solar panels do not need cooling water, increase grid security and help mute price shocks caused by the fluctuating prices of fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aThe following month, Georgia Power unveiled its latest pricing proposal.

VNASA and SpaceX launch cargo ships 3D Printer, radar instrument and 20 mice to International Space Station.\u000a\u000aA new beginning for NASA and the future of space travel of the United States started this week after the SpaceX Falcon rocket launch on Sunday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\u000a\u000aApparently, NASA awarded the privately-owned SpaceX the $1.6 Billion project, and the Falcon 9 rocket launch on Sunday is the fourth of the 12 planned.\u000a\u000aThe launch will bring the first "zero gravity" 3D printer to the ISS or International Space Station, in addition to bringing 20 mice, and an instrument to improve the radar system for hurricane forecasts.\u000a\u000aThe 20 mice are the first mammals to join the Dragon cargo capsule, and they're travelling for medical experiments. Meanwhile, the 3D printer named "Zero-G" was manufactured by Made In Space, and it will allow astronauts on board the ISS to manufacture tools including lab items -- a first of its kind and the first time that humans will manufacture things outside of the Earth's atmosphere.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won the whopping $2.6 Billion contract with NASA for SpaceX's first launch that will bring astronauts to space by 2017. The Dragon V2 was first unveiled back in May.\u000a\u000aThe advanced rocket and spacecraft maker was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, the same person who established the popular car company Tesla Motors.\u000a\u000aMusk, who is also the chief technology officer of SpaceX, said that the Dragon V2 rocket is a giant leap towards cheaper space travel. "As long as we continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft, we will never have true access to space," Musk said. "It will always be incredibly expensive."\u000a\u000aAdditional reports say that SpaceX will launch another rocket to deliver supplies to International Space Station by end of this year, and the company is also expected to test the Dragon V2's abort system which is a critical feature for safely bringing astronauts to outer space.\u000a\u000aImage from SpaceX.com.

VSAN DIEGO - In the first of what will be 16 hearings statewide, concerned homeowners voiced their opinion on what San Diego Gas & Electric proposes for the future.\u000a\u000a"This will be the biggest change in how rates are designed in a generation," said Mark Toney with consumer advocacy group The Utility Reform Network.\u000a\u000aThe rate structure hasn't changed since California's energy crisis in 2001.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the more a customer uses, the more they pay, but there are different rates under the four-tier system now in use.\u000a\u000a"Low users and high users should not have a 139 percent difference between those costs; it's not fair," said SDG&E spokesperson Stephanie Donovan.\u000a\u000aSDG&E and the two other utility companies in the state want to enact a service fee for meters, power lines and the like, authorized by the legislature.\u000a\u000a"It would initially be $5," Donovan said, who added it can go up to $10.\u000a\u000aWhat worries Toney is the proposal to have time use pricing. He said, "It means they can raise the rate at the hottest part of the afternoon or early evening."\u000a\u000aFor now, it's just a proposal. The Public Utilities Commission will hold hearings in El Cajon Thursday and continue throughout the state.\u000a\u000aA decision is not expected until early next year.

VFour companies proposed an $8-billion (U.S.) project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind energy generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling project - if approved and financed - would create one of the country's largest wind farms 40 miles north of Cheyenne, a huge energy storage site inside caverns in a Utah salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe power - potentially twice the amount produced by the 1930s-era dam, enough to serve 1.3 million people annually - would be sent on to California through an existing 490-mile line.\u000a\u000aIt's success hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aThe California agency, anchored to 11 municipal utilities, delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers. It's seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy and power storage. Agency officials did not immediately return a call for comment.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to burning coal for electricity. The proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boom to the sleepy ranching town of 216 nestled below beige sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 per cent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest under development in the U.S. is a 1,000-turbine site planned by Denver-based The Anschutz Corp. near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost - the government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year after flying into wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the companies' plan would be a $1.5-billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars has been invested in wind and solar projects. But finding an economical way to store energy has been a key issue given the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind or sun. Under the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using four caverns carved out of underground salt formations, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aWhen energy demand is low, excess electricity from the wind farm would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators, the statement said.

"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal.

VESA's Clean Space initiative, tasked with reducing the space industry's environmental impact on Earth and space, are planning to investigate new environmental-friendly methods like "lemon juice" for corrosion resistance and high strength stainless steel in order to make it an essential material for satellite and rocket designers.\u000a\u000aStainless steel has been commonly used in rockets and satellites for storage and handling of propellants and waste, components of thermal protection systems and fasteners such as high-strength bolts since centuries.\u000a\u000aBefore they are put to use, however, stainless steel parts must first be "passivated," stripping off their surface layer to remove any imperfections or contamination left over from the machining process, which might otherwise start to rust.\u000a\u000aTraditionally this was done by bathing the parts in nitric acid, but this has environmental and safety disadvantages. It involves special handling and produces nitrogen oxides, which are greenhouse gases and potentially harmful to workers.\u000a\u000aCitric acid, found in a dilute form in lemon juice, has been put forward as a greener passivation alternative, being adopted in a variety of sectors, including the medical, automotive and aerospace industries.\u000a\u000aSo the researchers aim to find whether this alternative option satisfies the unique requirements of the space industry.\u000a\u000aThe study would involve passivating stainless steel alloys and components typically used in the space sector, assessing their manufacturing process, then subjecting them to a gamut of environmental tests, including stress corrosion cracking, atmospheric and laboratory corrosion testing, adhesion testing and mechanical fatigue, along with a complete metallurgical analysis.

VHONOLULU -- Hawaiian Electric Co. has filed an ambitious plan to have 65 percent of its power come from renewable energy within 16 years.\u000a\u000aThe plan was filed late Tuesday with the Public Utilities Commission, just minutes before its deadline to do so. The company was under orders from the state agency to reduce energy costs and accommodate more solar power and other renewable energy on the grid.\u000a\u000aThe company also said the plan would cut customer bills by 20 percent, and it wants to convert remaining oil-fired power plants to liquefied natural gas, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\u000a\u000aHawaii News Now reported the commission will review the filing to determine if the plan is consistent with its earlier order and the state's energy goals.\u000a\u000aHawaiian Electric wants to nearly triple the amount of solar power by 2030. However, the plan outlines increased costs for residents using solar power, and the newspaper reports this could cause the company to not meet its goal.\u000a\u000aThere are three potential charges outlined in the plan for residents who power their homes with solar power.\u000a\u000aBesides a one-time connection fee, the changes would include increasing a fixed monthly charge from as low as $17 to $71 for solar customers on Oahu, and decreasing the amount the company pays residents for sending power to the grid. Residents are currently paid more than 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the new plans calls for that to be decreased to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.\u000a\u000aThe company says the plan is to gradually introduce these new costs, which will bring fairness to all utility customers. The plan also says solar customers didn't pay enough of the utility's fixed costs.\u000a\u000aMaking the costs more equal between solar and non-solar customers will allow the utility to cut bills for non-solar users by 20 percent, the company estimated.\u000a\u000aA state law passed in 2009 requires Hawaii's electric utilities to get 40 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2030.

VThe U.S. government will rewrite new food safety regulations after complaints by farmers that proposals earlier could hurt their business, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals by the FDA would allow U.S. farmers to meet the quality standards for water more easily and harvest crops earlier after using raw manure for fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules were offered by the FDA on Friday and next fall the final rules will be due. The FDA has haggled over the way to write them since 2010 when Congress passed its food safety law.\u000a\u000aRegulators said that balancing the need for tighter standards for food safety after big outbreaks in eggs, peanuts, cantaloupe and spinach, against needs of the farmers who are not used to such regulations, had been challenging.\u000a\u000aThe deputy commissioner at the FDA for foods, Michael Taylor, says the regulatory agency is attempting to achieve a food safety goal in a very practical way. The rules now, he added are new terrain for the U.S. agency.\u000a\u000aThe proposed rules last year required farmers to implement new precautions against types of contamination, making sure the hands of workers are washed, the water from irrigation is clean and that animals do not enter the fields amongst other things.\u000a\u000aManufacturers of food would also need to submit plans for food-safety to the U.S. government that show they are maintaining operations that are clean.\u000a\u000aThe changes would in a most cases require new paperwork, recording keeping and equipment.\u000a\u000aNone of priorities would be changed in the new rule, but following complaints from both the small and big farmers, who said the new rules were burdensome, the new proposal lowers some of the standards for the quantity of bacteria allowed in irrigation water while reducing the frequency it is tested in certain cases.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal reduces the time required between the fertilizing of crops using raw manure and the harvesting. It allows the farmers to hold their produce inside a packing house without more regulations.\u000a\u000aThe smaller farms would remain exempted from many rules.\u000a\u000aConcerns had been expressed by the organic industry over the rules.

VBefore they are put to use, however, stainless steel parts must first be "passivated," stripping off their surface layer to remove any imperfections or contamination left over from the machining process, which might otherwise start to rust.\u000a\u000aTraditionally this was done by bathing the parts in nitric acid, but this has environmental and safety disadvantages. It involves special handling and produces nitrogen oxides, which are greenhouse gases and potentially harmful to workers.\u000a\u000aCitric acid, found in a dilute form in lemon juice, has been put forward as a greener passivation alternative, being adopted in a variety of sectors, including the medical, automotive and aerospace industries.\u000a\u000aSo the researchers aim to find whether this alternative option satisfies the unique requirements of the space industry.\u000a\u000aThe study would involve passivating stainless steel alloys and components typically used in the space sector, assessing their manufacturing process, then subjecting them to a gamut of environmental tests, including stress corrosion cracking, atmospheric and laboratory corrosion testing, adhesion testing and mechanical fatigue, along with a complete metallurgical analysis.

VLeslie Knope may have a passion for public speaking, but she left Joshua Ritter "speechless" when he found out he'd be spending the day on the set of Parks and Recreation.\u000a\u000aRitter and his family flew out to Los Angeles from Illinois thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which organized a day for them to hang out with Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, Adam Scott, and other stars of the NBC show.\u000a\u000aRitter says the cast and crew made him feel like "family" -- so much so that he felt comfortable enough to perform a rap about Poehler he'd written in homage to Poehler's Sarah Palin rap. Poehler liked it so much that she had someone record it on her phone.\u000a\u000a"You can tell the difference when someone is being nice just to be nice and when someone is genuinely nice and caring," Ritter tells The Hollywood Reporter of Poehler. "It was really a huge surprise just how much she cared."\u000a\u000aRitter recently posted photos from the day on Reddit, where he also conducted an AMA about it.\u000a\u000aThe day was a dream come true for Ritter, a comedy fanatic who got to pick the brains of stars like Aziz Ansari -- who stopped by to say hi even though it was his day off -- and director Dean Holland and writer Matt Murray, both of whom chatted with Ritter in between takes.\u000a\u000aAmong the biggest surprises was Nick Offerman, whom Ritter says is exactly like his character Ron Swanson. One of the show's producers told Ritter it's hard not to laugh when Offerman calls from his car on the way to set, "because it sounds like Ron Swanson is calling."\u000a\u000aPoehler continues to send Ritter and his family gifts, most recently a copy of Leslie Knope's book Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America. Likewise, he has sent the Parks and Rec crew and stars mementos, including a picture form the visit.\u000a\u000a"They like hearing from us and kind of keep us in mind," says Ritter.\u000a\u000aRitter is currently a freshman at St. Louis University, where he studies business, with a concentration in leadership and change management. He's battling Von-Hippel Lindau syndrome, which has caused several tumors -- including one in his spine which was removed and left him in a wheelchair.\u000a\u000aRitter has also given back to St. Louis Children's Hospital, where he received medical care. In 2013 he raised $115,000 for the hospital through a direct mail campaign.\u000a\u000aHe's hoping sharing his story might inspire people to donate to Make-a-Wish.

VWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday unveiled a proposed roadmap for developing massive solar and wind projects in California's Mojave Desert while trying to minimize damage to desert habitat and animals.\u000a\u000aThe plan -- covering 22 million acres of public and private land -- follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's Mojave desert during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers siting sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday would designate a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted. Jewell's release Tuesday opened the plan for several months of public comment.\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020. Conservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species. The plant also proved unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be. "There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat. "The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VSept. 10--Deep into the third year of a historic drought, Californians are finally starting to take water conservation seriously.\u000a\u000aStatewide, urban residents cut water use 7.5 percent in July, compared with July of last year, according to new figures released Tuesday afternoon.\u000a\u000aThose savings show progress from June, when overall water use was down 4.4 percent from the previous year, and from May -- when it was up 1 percent.\u000a\u000a"People are stepping up," said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board. "It's not enough yet, but we are heading in the right direction."\u000a\u000aThe board's survey of 362 cities, private water companies and water districts -- the most extensive so far during California's drought -- continues to show Northern Californians are cutting water use more than Southern Californians.\u000a\u000aBay Area residents slashed water use 13 percent in July compared with July 2013, while residents in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas cut use only 1.7 percent.\u000a\u000aThe region with the most savings was the Sacramento area, which saw a 19.5 percent water reduction.\u000a\u000aSome of that difference is because of weather patterns, water officials said.\u000a\u000aAnother reason is that Los Angeles and San Diego already use less water per capita than other parts of the state -- 152 gallons a day in L.A. and 166 in San Diego -- compared with 279 gallons a day in Sacramento and 313 in Fresno.\u000a\u000a"In Southern California we have been doing conservation since 1991. As demand hardens, it becomes harder for the consumer to know what they can do to save water," said Ken Weinberg, water resources director with the San Diego County Water Authority.\u000a\u000aOne thing was clear from the new numbers: Cities with mandatory water rationing, water cops and fines for using more than an allotted amount showed the most savings.\u000a\u000aThe city with the most savings was tiny Cambria, a coastal community in San Luis Obispo County whose perennial water shortages have been exacerbated by the drought.\u000a\u000aWith strict rationing and a limit on new home construction because of water shortages, Cambria reduced water use 49 percent in July compared with the previous year.\u000a\u000aMost California cities have asked residents for voluntary conservation, have banned wasting water -- such as washing cars without hose nozzles -- and have passed rules limiting lawn watering to certain days of the week.\u000a\u000aStrict rules help\u000a\u000aBut cities with strict monthly water allotments saw massive savings.\u000a\u000aPleasanton and Livermore, with mandatory 25 percent cutbacks and fines for not reaching that percentage, cut use by 36.7 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\u000a\u000aSanta Cruz, which limits all homes to 10 units of water a month and issues penalties of $50 per unit above that, saw a 25.1 percent reduction.\u000a\u000a"Fines do make a big difference," Marcus said. "Over time, we may find that there are areas that need to up their enforcement."\u000a\u000aSome cities actually showed increases in water use. Wasco, near Bakersfield, saw a 29.8 percent increase. San Clemente was up 11.8 percent, Lodi 8.6 percent.\u000a\u000aExperts said the reasons why some cities increased their water consumption varied widely.\u000a\u000a"We've got different geography, different climate, different housing patterns. There's a lot of complexity," said David Bolland with the Association of California Water Agencies.\u000a\u000aIn the Bay Area, the largest water providers showed savings comparable to each other. The San Jose Water Co., a private company that has 1 million customers in Silicon Valley, cut water use 10.5 percent in July compared with July 2013.\u000a\u000aSan Francisco cut water use 6.9 percent. The Contra Costa Water District reduced water consumption 10.6 percent. And the East Bay Municipal Utility District cut consumption by 11.6 percent.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is in its worst drought since 1977. By some measures it's the worst in a century.\u000a\u000aMajor reservoirs are only about a third full. Rainfall totals in most major cities last winter were about 40 percent of normal. Farmers are desperately pumping groundwater to keep crops alive. Wildfire risk is at extreme levels. And wildlife is suffering as creeks run dry.\u000a\u000aHopes for a soaking El Nio winter this year have faded. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported "there is a 65 percent chance of El Nio "conditions starting later this year.\u000a\u000aBut ocean temperatures are only slightly warmer than normal, leading most researchers to predict a mild El Nio, "the type that historically has meant a wetter-than-normal winter in California only about half the time, instead of a strong El Nio -- "which has resulted in wet winters much more often.\u000a\u000aIn July, Marcus' agency passed rules requiring all cities, private companies and other urban water providers in California with more than 3,000 customers to report their water use to the state every month.\u000a\u000a"We felt the need to do this because water agencies were resting on their laurels," Marcus said. "And that is playing Russian roulette with Mother Nature, which is a bad idea. In Australia, they just had a drought that lasted a decade. They had to take drastic measures that they wouldn't have needed if they had begun conserving earlier."\u000a\u000aFines allowed\u000a\u000aIn addition to the new reporting rules, the state water board also voted in July to require water providers to limit the days when people could water lawns and to ban wasteful watering practices.\u000a\u000aThe new rules permitted fines of up to $500, although most cities and water agencies have chosen not to issue monetary penalties for violations.\u000a\u000aMarcus said Tuesday that because of the positive trend the state water board will not issue tougher rules over the next few months.\u000a\u000aBut, she added, that could happen if water use increases or the drought worsens because of a dry winter.\u000a\u000aPaul Rogers covers resources and environmental issues.

VThere's a lot of research happening on the International Space Station that can help us make advancements in science, technology and what we know about our universe. However, they usually don't seem as fun as this recent research program about to make its way back to Earth.\u000a\u000aA Scottish whiskey distillery set up an experiment several years ago to have astronauts develop whiskey particles in space. Now, the whiskey is making its way back home.\u000a\u000aArdbeg, a Scotch whisky distillery in Islay, Scotland, partnered with the Texas-based space research company NanoRacks to get the experiment off the ground. They sent 20 vials of whiskey particles, along with pieces of charred oak that they were treated with, into space in 2011. The vials didn't contain actual whiskey liquor but microbes that could be later used to brew whiskey.\u000a\u000aThe particles landed at the International Space Station where they have been orbiting the planet 15 times a day at 17,227 miles per hour. The point of the experiment is to see how the compounds in the vials, technically known as "terpenes," interact with the charred oak in Earth's gravity and then in micro-gravity in space. Terpenes can be found in flavorings and paints, in addition to whiskey.\u000a\u000a"NASA approved the project since terpenes have never been grown in zero-gravity conditions," NanoRacks CEO Jeffrey Manber told ABC News.\u000a\u000aManber also told ABC News that the findings of the research won't just impact future production of alcoholic beverages. The results of the experiment can also impact consumer products in general and help us better understand materials and biologicals.\u000a\u000aThe vials will be back on Earth on Sept. 12 where they will land in Kazakhstan. There's a nifty countdown clock featuring a bottle of Ardbeg whiskey soaring through space in case you need to quell your anticipation. Once the specimens are back on Earth, they will be shipped to NanoRack in Texas where the results of the maturation process will be examined. The findings will be revealed in a paper at a later date.\u000a\u000aWhiskey particles aren't even the weirdest objects to have been sent into space. LEGO figurines were launched into space as part of a partnership between NASA and the LEGO Group to encourage children to study science and technology. The original lightsaber Luke Skywalker used in "Star Wars Episode IV: Return of the Jedi" went out of this world with the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2007. There's even a company devoted to launching people's cremated remains into space called Celestis. One of its most famous participants is Gene Roddenberry, the creator of "Star Trek," whose remains are expected to be launched into space, along with his wife Majel, in 2016.\u000a\u000aSending normal, everyday objects into space will never stop fascinating us, will it?

VATLANTA - The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VInventHelp, a leading inventor service company, is working to submit the Wound Cleaner to companies for their consideration and possible feedback.\u000a\u000aCleaning a wound as quickly and thoroughly as possible is crucial in emergency situations. This inspired an inventor and registered nurse from Payson, Ariz., to design a better method of treating wounds. "I saw that there could be improvements made," she said, "so I've created an efficient method for wound infusions with the modified wound vac."\u000a\u000aCompact, easy to use and producible in design variations, the device can be used at home. It reduces the risk of nosocomial infections, which shortens hospital stays and promotes faster healing, as well as reduces insurance costs. The device is ideal for wounds such as those incurred during traumatic injury, as well as large decubitus and other large wounds.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Phoenix office of InventHelp.

VSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010\u000a\u000aAn unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to deliver a cargo ship to the International Space Station for NASA.\u000a\u000aThe 208-foot tall booster, built and launched by privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, bolted off its seaside launch pad at 1:52 a.m., slicing the night-time sky with a bright plume of light as it headed into orbit.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the Dragon cargo capsule perched on top of the rocket was released to begin a two-day journey to the space station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 260 miles above Earth.\u000a\u000aThe spaceship is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of equipment, supplies and science experiments, including 20 live mice for medical experiments, a prototype 3-D printer and an instrument to monitor ocean wind speeds.\u000a\u000aThe mission, which was delayed one day by poor weather, is the fourth under the company's 12-flight $1.6 billion NASA contract for cargo delivery services.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010.\u000a\u000a'We are ramping up for that launch rate, and actually even more than that,' Hans Koenigsmann, Space Exploration Technologies vice president of mission assurance, told reporters at a prelaunch news conference.\u000a\u000aThe company has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth nearly $5 billion, on its manifest, said SpaceX spokesman John Taylor.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won a second NASA contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to upgrade and fly its Dragon capsules for astronauts - and potentially paying tourists as well.\u000a\u000aA crewed Dragon spaceship is targeted for a debut test flight in 2016.\u000a\u000aNASA also awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop and fly a second space taxi. The price difference is primarily the cost of the launcher.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61 million.\u000a\u000aBoeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150 million. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, manufactures and sells Atlas 5, which predominantly are used for U.S. military missions.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is gunning for that business as well.\u000a\u000aA lawsuit is pending in federal court contesting the U.S. Air Force's latest non-competed award to United Launch Alliance.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 13 times, all successfully.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The public is invited to a free talk called "The Case of the Missing Martian Atmosphere" with Dr. Jared Espley in the Pickford Theater, third floor, Madison Building, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. on Thursday, September 18 at 11:30 a.m. EDT.\u000a\u000aJared Espley is a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and a team member on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. His talk will focus on climate change on Mars and the MAVEN mission.\u000a\u000aSeveral types of evidence from past Mars missions lead us to believe that Mars used to be much different from the dry, cold place we find today. Ancient gullies and canyons look as if they were carved by flowing water, minerals that can only be made in standing water have been found, and ancient volcanoes of many sizes litter the surface. Clearly, the atmosphere had to have been thicker and possibly warmer to support so much liquid water on the surface.\u000a\u000aWhat happened? Because Mars lacks a planetary-sized magnetic field, the solar wind is able to gradually erode its upper atmosphere. Could a whole atmosphere's worth of erosion have taken place? MAVEN which was launched on November 18, 2013 and is set to arrive September 21 should help us explore this possibility.\u000a\u000a"MAVEN's goals are related to one of the fundamental mysteries of Mars -- we want to figure out how Mars went from a warm, wet environment to the cold, dry desert we see today," Espley said.\u000a\u000aHe notes that the spacecraft won't actually touch down on the planet, but will dip into its atmosphere, enter an elliptical orbit, and sample the solar wind. It will examine how the atmosphere is thinning and why water disappeared over the area. Scientists hope that discovering more about how the climate on Mars shifted over long periods of time could offer greater understanding of our changing climate here on Earth.\u000a\u000aClimate Change on Mars is the first program of the 2014 fall science series of lectures sponsored by the Library's Science, Technology and Business division in partnership with NASA Goddard.\u000a\u000aIf you cannot make it to the lecture, it will be captured and later broadcast on the Library's science/technology webcast page and YouTube channel "Topics in Science" playlist in the coming months. In the meantime, you might be interested in viewing Dr. Pamela Conrad's 2013 program Extraterrestrial Real Estate- Measuring Habitability on Mars with the Curiosity Rover. You can view a recording of the program on the Library's Webcast page or YouTube channel. Also, NASA scientist Dr. James Garvin visited the Library in 2010 to give a Mars Update- you can view a webcast or YouTube video of his 2010 presentation.\u000a\u000aFor more information about NASA's MAVEN mission, visit:\u000a\u000awww.nasa.gov/maven\u000a\u000aLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\u000a\u000aSOURCE NASA\u000a\u000aCopyright (C) 2014 PR Newswire.

VSDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides safe and reliable energy service to 3.4 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and 861,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 ...\u000a\u000aSAN DIEGO, Sept. 16, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Starting today, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) customers will have the chance to speak out about proposed changes in electric rates in the first of 16 public participation hearings on the issue scheduled throughout California over the next several weeks. Representatives of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) are hosting the hearings and will consider all of the public input as part of the ongoing regulatory process before making a decision.\u000a\u000aSDG&E, and the state's other investor-owned electric utilities, filed rate reform proposals earlier this year to implement the goals of Assembly Bill 327, the Ratepayer Equity Act, which became law in January. The measure allows the CPUC to make changes to the current outdated rate structure, including lifting restrictions on rates for lower-use customers, which is a leftover from the energy crisis.\u000a\u000a"Many of our customers are being negatively impacted because they use more energy based on the geographic area in which they live in or the size of their families," said Caroline Winn, SDG&E's vice president - customer services. "Our goal is to 'level the playing field' and to move rates for all customers closer to what it actually costs the utility to provide electric service."\u000a\u000aThe CPUC has given the utilities a road map for rate design changes that is guided by core principles, including spreading costs fairly across all customers, making rates easier to understand while also continuing to encourage conservation. Earlier this summer, regulators took an important first step to narrow the gap between the highest and lowest rates paid by California's utility customers. Longer-term rate reform will help to ensure that all customers share more equally in supporting ongoing enhancements to the power network that everyone uses and depends on to meet their energy needs.\u000a\u000aSDG&E's long-term rate reform proposal includes the following key elements:\u000a\u000aState legislation essentially froze rates for lower-use customers during the energy crisis to protect them in an unstable energy market; however, their rates stayed the same for a decade with only slight increases in just the last couple of years. As a result, hundreds of thousands of customers today are paying approximately $350 million more a year than they should be for the significant growth in technology and infrastructure over the past decade including improvements to the power network, more renewable energy, and compliance with environmental mandates.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, below-cost rates have undermined the incentive to conserve, while punishing others who use more electricity with rates that are significantly higher than the cost to serve them," said Winn.\u000a\u000aIf the CPUC approves SDG&E's proposal, lower-tier rates are expected to see a moderate increase of 8 percent on average, while higher-use rates are expected to get immediate relief with a decrease of as much as 30 percent.\u000a\u000aSDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides safe and reliable energy service to 3.4 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and 861,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles. SDG&E is committed to creating ways to help customers save energy and money every day.

VThe Department of Energy has asked for suggestions from companies to provide ideas for managing and shifting the radioactive nuclear waste. The shifting of nuclear waste from power plants to disposal sites is a crucial project. However, the government officials are clueless about how to proceed with the project.\u000a\u000aThe Energy Department officials have set 2021 as deadline for selecting interim storage location and 2048 as long-term dumping site for radioactive nuclear waste from power plants.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Energy has asked for opinion regarding purchase or lease for the rail cars. The rail cars with heavy protective casks will most probably run on the regular tracks at normal speed. The U.S. military already uses the railway network to shift radioactive waste from Navy ships to storage sites.\u000a\u000a"You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car," said Everett Redmond of the Nuclear Energy Institute.\u000a\u000aThe federal government has not yet decided a location to dump the radioactive waste. The five-member board that governs Nuclear Regulatory Commission has voted on issuing new power plant licenses. By law, the federal government is responsible for safe disposal of nuclear waste. After a recent lawsuit, the Energy department has stopped charging fee for disposal of nuclear waste from electricity consumers.

VYou'd be forgiven for not knowing that today is National Ceiling Fan Day. An green initiative spearheaded in 2013 by the American Lighting Association, fan manufacturers, and leading energy conservation groups, the aim of National Ceiling Fan Day is to draw attention to the intrinsic energy efficiency of fans over air conditioning units. Ceiling fans, on average, use a fraction of the energy hogged by air conditioners, and with autumn in the air (for most of us), National Ceiling Fan Day is as good a reminder as any to shelve those air conditioners for the rest of the year, in favor of the breezy ambience bestowed by ceiling fans. Design enthusiasts, luckily, have a slew of modern fans to choose from, thanks to brands like Modern Fan, Matthews Fan Company, and Fanimation. Our Fanimation fans, incidentally, are on sale for a few more days, so have a look at our stylish Fanimation collection today, and, well, catch the breeze, while you can.\u000a\u000aLink

VPittsburgh-based InventHelp is attempting to submit this idea, the My Sleep Personal Alarm Clock, to companies for their review.\u000a\u000a"Almost half of the U.S. population admits to having trouble maintaining a consistent sleep schedule," said an inventor from Harvard, Ill. "In order to help people fall asleep and wake up according to their own routine, I came up with this sleep aid."\u000a\u000aHe developed the My Sleep Personal Alarm Clock to enable the user to fall asleep and wake up in a more natural manner. The accessory helps the user go to bed when he or she wishes. It also aids the user in waking up at the desired time.\u000a\u000aThe unit eliminates the stress and discomfort of having to wake up to a buzzing alarm clock. Furthermore, the invention promotes more restful sleep and is designed for ease of use. Also, there are third-party implications of the device administering prescription and over-the-counter medication via the external timed-delivery system.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

VIn advance of the Brooklyn Heights Blog's presentation September 2 of one of the few public discussions on the 52nd Assembly District Race, an important political contest in New York City this year, the BHB sat down with longtime Cobble Hill resident Jo Anne Simon to discuss her candidacy for the seat that outgoing Assembly Member Joan Millman has occupied for the past 17 years.\u000a\u000aMs. Simon, who has an impressive resume of political accomplishments, including serving as Democratic State Committeewoman and District Leader for the past 10 years, boasts endorsements from many leading New York City Democrats, including Congresswoman Nydia Velzquez, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer, Democratic County Leader Frank Seddio and Ms. Millman.\u000a\u000aThis is the second in a series of interviews with all three candidates on the ballot for the 52nd Assembly seat; on consecutive days this week BHB will provide exclusive coverage of a political contest that will have a substantial impact on the future of Long Island College Hospital (LICH), proposed affordable housing in Brooklyn Bridge Park's Pier 6, and the planned sale of the Brooklyn Heights Library site for subsequent development as a high-rise residential tower.\u000a\u000aMichael Randazzo, Brooklyn Heights Blog: Please explain what you bring to the 52nd Assembly Race.\u000a\u000aJo Anne Simon: This is a critical time for the 52nd Assembly District. Brooklyn is hot, and this [district] is one of the hottest areas in Brooklyn. I've been living in the district for 33 years and have been a community activist for 20. I have seen tremendous changes. I know where we've been and where we come from and am familiar with the pressures of where we're going.\u000a\u000aI'm running because I've been active, I know all corners of the district, and I want to bring [a] community voice with me. I also have been politically active as the district leader for the past 10 years, standing up to the party bosses in the Brooklyn Democratic Party and I want to bring the voice of independence with me [to Albany].\u000a\u000aBHB: Because you have been the district leader for the past 10 years, how might your approach to serving in the NYS Assembly both reflect and differ from Joan Millman's tenure?\u000a\u000aJS: There are a number of issues that I've worked with Joan on that I would be in accord with her. Joan and I have slightly different background. I'm a former teacher of the deaf [and now] a civil rights lawyer. Joan is a former teacher and school librarian.\u000a\u000aI've had a career where I've made my own way. My law practice is idiosyncratic: I created an area of law and I have a broader reach and an area of expertise that is different than Joan's. I've been working at the intersection of education, disability rights and standardized testing for many years. It's a[n] unusual mix but it's very important in the state assembly right now... [given] the difficulties we've had implementing the Common Core. How are we testing? Why are we testing? What are we testing -- because they haven't finished the curriculum yet. I have a lot of expertise in those areas that I want to bring to the Assembly.

VDENVER (AP) -- GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a press release touting the turbine ad that first aired on Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000a-- -- --\u000a\u000aKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt\u000a\u000aGardner's Next Generation Energy ad: http://bit.ly/1qdgy63

VBEIJING: China has unveiled its latest military hardware on primetime television, an advanced air defence system that reports said has a "high success rate" destroying incoming missiles and aircraft.\u000a\u000aThe HongQi-10 (Reg Flag 10) surface-to-air missile was shown in the evening news bulletin Wednesday (Sep 10) being fired from ships and land-based mobile launchers, and exploding in the sky on impact with its target.\u000a\u000aIt will protect warships against rockets over a limited area, and will be used alongside an "area defence system" which covers a larger area but has a slower response time, the state-run Global Times newspaper said Thursday (Sep 11).\u000a\u000a"As a naval point defence missile system, HongQi-10 boasts a particularly quick response to low-altitude missiles that area defence systems fail to intercept," it quoted Lan Yun, deputy chief editor of monthly journal Modern Ships, as saying. It cited him adding that it had a high success rate in hitting its targets.\u000a\u000aMissiles only 1.5-10m (5-30 feet) above sea level can be targeted with the new system, which takes only 10 seconds to launch, Lan said. The missiles can also used to protect ground forces from air attacks by "jets, unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles", the Global Times report said, citing an expert.\u000a\u000aBeijing has been increasing its military might and naval reach in recent years, and President Xi Jinping regularly urges the country to strengthen its ability to "win battles".

VDeep into the third year of a historic drought, Californians are finally starting to take water conservation seriously.\u000a\u000aStatewide, urban residents cut water use 7.5 percent in July, compared with July of last year, according to new figures released Tuesday afternoon.\u000a\u000aThose savings show progress from June, when overall water use was down 4.4 percent from the previous year, and from May -- when it was up 1 percent.\u000a\u000a"People are stepping up," said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board. "It's not enough yet, but we are heading in the right direction."\u000a\u000aThe board's survey of 362 cities, private water companies and water districts -- the most extensive so far during California's drought -- continues to show Northern Californians are cutting water use more than Southern Californians.\u000a\u000aBay Area residents slashed water use 13 percent in July compared with July 2013, while residents in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas cut use only 1.7 percent.\u000a\u000aThe region with the most savings was the Sacramento area, which saw a 19.5 percent water reduction.\u000a\u000aSome of that difference is because of weather patterns, water officials said.\u000a\u000aAnother reason is that Los Angeles and San Diego already use less water per capita than other parts of the state -- 152 gallons a day in L.A. and 166 in San Diego -- compared with 279 gallons a day in Sacramento and 313 in Fresno.\u000a\u000a"In Southern California we have been doing conservation since 1991. As demand hardens, it becomes harder for the consumer to know what they can do to save water," said Ken Weinberg, water resources director with the San Diego County Water Authority.\u000a\u000aOne thing was clear from the new numbers: Cities with mandatory water rationing, water cops and fines for using more than an allotted amount showed the most savings.\u000a\u000aThe city with the most savings was tiny Cambria, a coastal community in San Luis Obispo County whose perennial water shortages have been exacerbated by the drought.\u000a\u000aWith strict rationing and a limit on new home construction because of water shortages, Cambria reduced water use 49 percent in July compared with the previous year.\u000a\u000aMost California cities have asked residents for voluntary conservation, have banned wasting water -- such as washing cars without hose nozzles -- and have passed rules limiting lawn watering to certain days of the week.\u000a\u000aStrict rules help\u000a\u000aBut cities with strict monthly water allotments saw massive savings.\u000a\u000aPleasanton and Livermore, with mandatory 25 percent cutbacks and fines for not reaching that percentage, cut use by 36.7 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\u000a\u000aSanta Cruz, which limits all homes to 10 units of water a month and issues penalties of $50 per unit above that, saw a 25.1 percent reduction.\u000a\u000a"Fines do make a big difference," Marcus said. "Over time, we may find that there are areas that need to up their enforcement."\u000a\u000aSome cities actually showed increases in water use. Wasco, near Bakersfield, saw a 29.8 percent increase. San Clemente was up 11.8 percent, Lodi 8.6 percent.\u000a\u000aExperts said the reasons why some cities increased their water consumption varied widely.\u000a\u000a"We've got different geography, different climate, different housing patterns. There's a lot of complexity," said David Bolland with the Association of California Water Agencies.\u000a\u000aIn the Bay Area, the largest water providers showed savings comparable to each other. The San Jose Water Co., a private company that has 1 million customers in Silicon Valley, cut water use 10.5 percent in July compared with July 2013.\u000a\u000aSan Francisco cut water use 6.9 percent. The Contra Costa Water District reduced water consumption 10.6 percent. And the East Bay Municipal Utility District cut consumption by 11.6 percent.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is in its worst drought since 1977. By some measures it's the worst in a century.\u000a\u000aMajor reservoirs are only about a third full. Rainfall totals in most major cities last winter were about 40 percent of normal. Farmers are desperately pumping groundwater to keep crops alive. Wildfire risk is at extreme levels. And wildlife is suffering as creeks run dry.\u000a\u000aHopes for a soaking El Nio winter this year have faded. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported there is a 65 percent chance of El Nio conditions starting later this year.\u000a\u000aBut ocean temperatures are only slightly warmer than normal, leading most researchers to predict a mild El Nio, the type that historically has meant a wetter-than-normal winter in California only about half the time, instead of a strong El Nio -- which has resulted in wet winters much more often.\u000a\u000aIn July, Marcus' agency passed rules requiring all cities, private companies and other urban water providers in California with more than 3,000 customers to report their water use to the state every month.\u000a\u000a"We felt the need to do this because water agencies were resting on their laurels," Marcus said. "And that is playing Russian roulette with Mother Nature, which is a bad idea. In Australia, they just had a drought that lasted a decade. They had to take drastic measures that they wouldn't have needed if they had begun conserving earlier."\u000a\u000aFines allowed\u000a\u000aIn addition to the new reporting rules, the state water board also voted in July to require water providers to limit the days when people could water lawns and to ban wasteful watering practices.\u000a\u000aThe new rules permitted fines of up to $500, although most cities and water agencies have chosen not to issue monetary penalties for violations.\u000a\u000aMarcus said Tuesday that because of the positive trend the state water board will not issue tougher rules over the next few months.\u000a\u000aBut, she added, that could happen if water use increases or the drought worsens because of a dry winter.\u000a\u000aPaul Rogers covers resources and environmental issues.

VSponsored by\u000a\u000aHONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaiian Electric Co. has filed a plan to have 65 percent of its power come from renewable energy within 16 years.\u000a\u000aThe plan was filed late Tuesday with the Public Utilities Commission, just minutes before its deadline to do so. The company was under orders from the state agency to reduce energy costs and accommodate more solar power and other renewable energy on the grid.\u000a\u000aThe company also said the plan would cut customer bills by 20 percent, and it wants to convert remaining oil-fired power plants to liquefied natural gas, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\u000a\u000aHawaii News Now reported the commission will review the filing to determine if the plan is consistent with its earlier order and the state's energy goals.\u000a\u000aHawaiian Electric wants to nearly triple the amount of solar power by 2030. However, the plan outlines increased costs for residents using solar power, and the newspaper reports this could cause the company to not meet its goal.\u000a\u000aThere are three potential charges outlined in the plan for residents who power their homes with solar power.\u000a\u000aBesides a one-time connection fee, the changes would include increasing a fixed monthly charge from as low as $17 to $71 for solar customers on Oahu, and decreasing the amount the company pays residents for sending power to the grid. Residents are currently paid more than 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, but the new plans calls for that to be decreased to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.\u000a\u000aThe company says the plan is to gradually introduce these new costs, which will bring fairness to all utility customers. The plan also says solar customers didn't pay enough of the utility's fixed costs.\u000a\u000aMaking the costs more equal between solar and non-solar customers will allow the utility to cut bills for non-solar users by 20 percent, the company estimated.\u000a\u000aA state law passed in 2009 requires Hawaii's electric utilities to get 40 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2030.

VDENVER, Aug. 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Flanked by more than a dozen kindergarten students, the founder of SunShare, Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock and the principal of Academy 360 public charter school today announced a new program to provide free solar energy to all families of children who attend the school.\u000a\u000a"We are grateful to SunShare for helping us bring green, sustainable solar energy to our families. Not only are we contributing to a healthy environment, but every dollar that is saved on electricity is a dollar that families can spend on healthier foods, after school programs, books for their home, and other essential family needs," said Sally Sorte, principal of Academy 360.\u000a\u000a"I want to commend SunShare for being a good community member and creating this program for the families of Academy 360," said Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. "Here in Denver, our goal is to create livable communities, and that means helping to provide the opportunities residents need to inject sustainable practices into their daily lives. With Community Solar, not only can more people enjoy the benefits of clean, renewable solar energy, they'll see a reduction in their electricity bills as well."\u000a\u000a"Through this donation, SunShare is honoring the spirit and intent of Colorado's landmark Community Solar law, and we could not find a better partner than Academy 360," said David Amster-Olszewski, founder of SunShare. "This school and the innovative learning program is changing education for all students, just as Community Solar is changing the future of energy."\u000a\u000aThe school is also launching a fundraising program so that eventually all families could have their entire energy bill offset by free solar energy. Anyone wishing to donate can do so at academy360.org.\u000a\u000aUnder the program announced today SunShare will provide free Community Solar energy from its Denver County Solar Garden. Groundbreaking on the Solar Garden is set for late this fall and families should begin seeing reductions in their bills by the early spring. In the coming months, SunShare employees will work with families to get them signed up so they can start receiving free solar energy as soon as the Solar Garden is online.

VWASHINGTON (AP) - The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food - including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VWyoming -- already the site for the nation's biggest wind farm project -- would be home to another $8 billion wind farm under a proposal unveiled by four companies Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe project, backed by Duke Energy Corp., Dresser-Rand Group and two others, would consist of a 2,100-megawatt wind farm in southeast Wyoming, a 525-mile power line and an energy storage facility.\u000a\u000aPhil Anschutz's Denver-based Power Company of Wyoming already is developing a $9 billion, 10,000-megawatt wind farm in south-central Wyoming and 725-mile TransWest Express transmission line.\u000a\u000aBoth projects are aiming to sell their power to California utilities.\u000a\u000a"They are both trying to serve the same market, but there are some big renewable energy demands in California," said Loyd Drain, executive director of the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority.\u000a\u000aCalifornia has the highest renewable energy standard in the nation for its utilities -- requiring 33 percent of their electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020.\u000a\u000aThe new project will be near Chugwater, about 40 miles north of Cheyenne. But its major innovation would be its ability to store wind energy hundreds of miles away at a $1.5 billion energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aEnergy would be stored through a compressed-air system using four caverns carved out of underground salt formations, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan.\u000a\u000aThe Hoover Dam, completed in 1936, produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe success of the Wyoming wind project, however, hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst at Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aThe developers said they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aEnergy demand in Los Angeles is projected to rise as much as 18 percent by 2024, according to the California Energy Commission.\u000a\u000aThe Anschutz project has been in development since 2006 and has already cleared several state and U.S. regulatory hurdles.\u000a\u000aKara Choquette, a spokeswoman for the Power Company of Wyoming, said in an e-mail, "Our policy is not to comment on specific proposed projects, especially prior to initiation of the formal permitting processes."\u000a\u000aThe Power Company of Wyoming's Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, near Rawlins, is "well-advanced in its federal permitting process," she said.\u000a\u000aThe TransWest Express project is also moving ahead with a final decision from federal regulations expected early next year, Choquette said.\u000a\u000a"I may be an optimist," the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority's Drain said, " but I think Wyoming is going to sell a lot of wind power to California."\u000a\u000aMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912, mjaffe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bymarkjaffe

VATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VA SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule is on its way to the International Space Station after an early Sunday launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. NASA video. Posted Sept. 21, 2014\u000a\u000a9 CONNECT 7 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aRoughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments are on their way to the International Space Station after a successful 1:52 a.m. blastoff by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon is expected to take two days to chase down the station, arriving around 7 a.m. Tuesday. A three-person crew will snare the free-floating spacecraft with a 58-foot robotic arm and attach it to a docking port for a month-long stay.\u000a\u000aAmong the cargo are 20 mice that are the first mammals to fly aboard the Dragon, part of a new rodent research program on ISS; the first 3-D printer in space; and a radar instrument that will improve hurricane forecasts.\u000a\u000aThe resupply mission is the fourth of 12 planned by SpaceX under a $1.6 billion NASA contract.\u000a\u000aSpaceX last week won a $2.6 billion contract from NASA to launch astronauts to the outpost in an upgraded Dragon, by 2017.\u000a\u000aThe launch came on the mission's second attempt, after weather scrubbed the first try Saturday.\u000a\u000aSunday's forecast started out iffy but improved to near-perfect conditions within an hour of the instantaneous window at Launch Complex 40.\u000a\u000aA quiet countdown culminated with nine Merlin 1D engines igniting with 1.3 million pounds of thrust and the 208-foot rocket rumbling northeast over the Atlantic Ocean trailing a comet-like streak of flame.\u000a\u000aMore than four minutes into the flight, the receding upper stage was still visible as a pinpoint of orange light amid a smattering of stars. Cameras showed the Dragon separate from the rocket less than 10 minutes after liftoff and then deploy its power-generating solar arrays.\u000a\u000aSpaceX planned to try to fly the first-stage booster back to a soft ocean landing in another test of reusable rocket technology, though it did not expect to recover the booster intact.\u000a\u000aThe launch was the 13th by a Falcon 9, and SpaceX's second from the same Cape pad in two weeks. following its Sept. 7 launch of a commercial satellite. That's the company's fastest turnaround between launches yet and close to a record at the Cape, according to a company official.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's next launch of ISS cargo is tentatively planned in December. SpaceX may have one other launch planned this year and also hopes to perform a test of the Dragon's launch abort system, a key system for future crewed flights, here before the end of the year.\u000a\u000a9 CONNECT 7 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1se3GPI

VInventHelp, based in Pittsburgh, is attempting to submit the S.S.P. & C. to applicable companies for their review.\u000a\u000aWith school shootings making the headlines all too often, safety remains as a top priority in schools. While schools continue to tighten security, an inventor from Iron City, Ga., has found a way for parents to take an active role in protecting their children.\u000a\u000aHe developed S.S.P. & C. specifically to prevent serious injuries and deaths from exposure to gunfire. Designed as a safety shield for school students, it allows them to feel more confident, safe and secure when attending school. In turn, it provides peace of mind for parents and school employees.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, it is convenient, easy to use and affordably priced. It is also lightweight, portable and comfortable. In addition, it is durable for years of effective use and beneficial for anyone who carries a backpack.\u000a\u000aThe inventor's reaction to the tragedy of school shootings prompted him to invent this item.

VSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State and federal officials sought Tuesday to bring order to California's boom for renewable-energy plants in the Mojave and other southern California deserts, releasing a roadmap covering 22.5 million acres that designates some areas for large-scale solar, wind and geothermal plants and others for conservation of desert habitat and animals.\u000a\u000a"We have amazingly special places here," U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a news conference at a desert wind farm near Palm Springs with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and other officials releasing the multi-agency draft plan.\u000a\u000aBy taking a look at the desert as a whole, Jewell said, the plan's designers are ensuring "the areas that should be protected are set aside. The areas that should be developed are streamlined" for building utility-scale renewable energy plants.\u000a\u000aThe release of the plan follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's deserts during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers placing sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday recommends designating a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be among the areas set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted.\u000a\u000aJewell's release of the plan opens a period of public comment through January. Renewable-energy developers and conservationists said they would be studying the more than 8,000 pages to learn exactly how areas were designated and under what rules.\u000a\u000aThe 22.5 million acres of public and private land in seven southeastern California counties were "enough land for us to find a way to both protect species as well as find a way to develop renewable energy," Anne Baker of the renewable-energy industry's Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said after the plan's release. "We can figure this out."\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after five years of consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers, American Indian tribes and others.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020.\u000a\u000aConservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion solar plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species.\u000a\u000aThe plant, using a different form of solar energy than solar panels, also has proven unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays. NRG and BrightSource officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be.\u000a\u000a"There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat.\u000a\u000a"The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VCONSTRUCTION has begun on a $US1 billion ($A1.08 billion) solar power generating station in the Mojave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aTHE 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles (10 square kilometres) of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative. Executives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $US1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line. Kornze said in a statement that since 2009 the Bureau of Land Management has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country. "The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said. When completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March. First Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 50-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm. Silver State North, owned by Canada-based Enbridge Inc., was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area. Silver State South will be owned by a subsidiary of NextEra, and will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract. "Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality." Several more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VHow to demonstrate you're a new kind of Colorado Republican politician, that you're not the kind of old-school Republican pol who doesn't embrace full-range health-care for women, comprehensive immigration reform or full-speed-ahead clean-energy development? In other words, how do you try to persuade voters that you're not the the kind of Republican politician who has been losing in top-tier statewide races for years?\u000a\u000aCongressman Cory Gardner, who is running to unseat U.S. Senator Mark Udall, chose to do it this week by running an ad in which he says he "co-wrote the law that launched our green-energy economy." The media-sphere reacted with skepticism.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's history with environmental issues is a little more nuanced than the ad might suggest," wrote TPM. "Back in 2010, shortly after he was elected to the U.S. House in a campaign where he railed against cap-and-trade legislation, Gardner told Environment and Energy Daily, according to an archived story accessed through LexisNexis: 'I believe climate change is happening. I'm just not convinced man is causing it.'"\u000a\u000aThe history behind the ad has become even more "nuanced" today. The AP's Kristen Wyatt looked into the law Gardner is touting. Her story's lead paragraph is now rocketing around the politics Twittersphere and has landed in reporter email boxes across the state.\u000a\u000a"GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project."\u000a\u000aThe 2007 law Gardner is talking about established The Clean Energy Development Authority. Here's how Wyatt describes the fleeting life of the Authority: "[It] had financing caveats that made it toothless... [It] never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office."\u000a\u000aGardner this year has struggled to recast his conservative votes on social issues to win over the moderate voters who decide statewide races in Colorado. Weeks after launching his Senate bid, he famously said he no longer supported the hardline anti-abortion Personhood movement, even though he championed it as a lawmaker for years and even though he still is listed as a co-sponsor of federal personhood legislation.\u000a\u000aGardner likewise has been a top advocate for the oil and gas industry in Washington. He attends oil-billionaire Koch-brother gatherings, and the oil industry has made up the majority share of his campaign donation over the course of his career in Washington. So far, his three-day makeover as a green-energy champion has been... bumpy.

VA hotel's success in the hospitality industry is measured by the quality and value of its guests' experience, and that requires the hotel to deliver consistently flawless service and reliable comfort at a competitive rate. Managing energy consumption and associated costs -- while improving environmental sustainability -- are among the significant operational challenges. Not only are hotels operational 24/7/365, they are typically characterized by considerable load diversity over 24 hours.\u000a\u000aIn January, EMCOR Services Mesa Energy Systems ("EMCOR Services Mesa") was part of a team that successfully met these challenges at the Hilton Los Angeles Universal City Hotel, which completed an overall building system upgrade undertaken and announced as "transformational" of the facility into a sustainable destination hotel. Located at 555 Universal Hollywood Dr., in Universal City, CA, the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is a block away from the entrance to Universal Studios Hollywood and minutes from Hollywood. The 23-story, 502,200-sq-ft hotel has approximately 500 guest rooms, and it includes a 16,000-sq-ft ballroom and 32,000 sq ft of meeting space.\u000a\u000aEMCOR Services Mesa was chosen to be part of the multidiscipline Los Angeles County Commercial PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Program project development team selected by Hilton and coordinated by sustainability firm ReNewAll. Los Angeles County PACE financing was used to fund $7 million in sustainability upgrades for the Hilton project, making it the largest C-PACE project in the U.S. to date. C-PACE programs are available to property owners to pay for building improvements that save energy, and EMCOR Services Mesa was chosen as the mechanical contractor on the project, in part, because of its knowledge and familiarity with the C-PACE program.\u000a\u000aOverall, Hilton has stated it anticipates the project to yield estimated annual energy savings of $800,000, of which the company stands to save more than 2 million kWh and $300,000 in savings on electricity consumption from a new high-efficiency chiller system and building automation system -- realizing a simple payback on investment in just 3.7 years -- plus significant reductions in environmental impact from greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aEMCOR Services Mesa's scope of work included the replacement of both existing constant speed, centrifugal chillers with two high-efficiency 450-ton centrifugal, variable-speed-driven chillers; VSD to serve condenser water and chilled water pumps; chilled and condenser water piping, including required pipe trim; central plant DDC and optimization; and an ASHRAE 15 ventilation system upgrade.\u000a\u000aThe project included energy-efficient glass and LED lighting, as well as water-conservation measures (including 500 low-flow shower heads and the replacement of 250 bathtubs with showers), which are projected to yield savings of $28,000 and conserve more than 2.8 million gallons of water a year.\u000a\u000aEMCOR Services Mesa also completed an extensive, fast-tracked HVAC retrofit for the entrance foyer and ballroom under a separate contract in time for a ribbon-cutting ceremony on January 28, 2014, featuring a speech by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in recognition of Hilton's completion of the project.\u000a\u000aCompared with other commercial buildings, hospitals, and data centers, where loads are fairly constant over operating hours, hotels are characterized by load diversity due to the fluctuations in occupancy of guest rooms, use of restaurant and lounge facilities, conference and meeting spaces and ballrooms, etc. In addition, hotels typically use extensive glass on their facades, and the older glass technologies often found in existing hotels typically contribute to significant heat gain. The Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City Hotel was no exception in these respects.\u000a\u000aIn fact, when an existing conditions inspection was performed in autumn 2012 in preparation for submission of a bid proposal, the chiller plant was running at a light load. An inventory of all the components and a rough calculation of efficiency revealed that the existing plant was operating at greater than 2.0 kW/ton, whereas EMCOR Services Mesa strives for a chiller plant system design that meets a performance goal of 0.5 kw/ton on average. The discrepancy between existing and optimal performance at the Hilton was not surprising given that some of the equipment was 30 years old. In fact, one of the chillers had experienced a recent catastrophic motor failure. The Hilton was renting a temporary chiller at a cost of approximately $20,000 a month to meet its hospitality service standards for its guests.\u000a\u000aFast forward to the following August, when Hilton awarded the mechanical contract to EMCOR Services Mesa, the company repaired the existing chiller, providing spare parts at no cost from the inventory of similar chillers in its warehouse. Technicians got the damaged chiller up and running in approximately three weeks, enabling Hilton to return the temporary chiller months before completion of the mechanical upgrade.\u000a\u000aIn preparing the bid proposal, the EMCOR Services Mesa engineering team performed a comparative energy analysis of the existing chiller plant and two alternative upgrades -- two 450-ton chillers versus two 475-ton chillers. (See sidebar for details of the existing and new chiller systems.) The Hilton's utility rates were built into the model to provide an estimate of annual operating costs and savings. The analysis took into account the integrated energy conservation measures (ECMs), in particular, retrofitting with Smart Glass in public areas and window tinting on the guest tower to reduce solar heat gain and a lighting retrofit and installation of ECM motors on guest room fan coils to further reduce the internal load. As a result, the design was able to downsize the York replacement chillers by 10% -- from 475 tons to 450 tons.\u000a\u000aAs part of the proposal, the EMCOR Services Mesa team also included the results of an analysis using the Energy Star Building Label Benchmarking Tool. With a building floor area of 502,200 sq ft and an average of 168 operating hours a week, the 450-ton York chiller system is projected to save over 2 million kWh of electricity annually. At an average blended rate of 15 cents per kWh, the Hilton stands to save approximately $300,000 annually on the cost of electricity.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the new chiller equipment exceeds the minimum energy-efficiency standards of the California 2010 Green Building Standards Energy Code (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, part 11). As a result, the Hilton was able to realize the maximum rebate on the purchase of the new chiller equipment.\u000a\u000aThe team also shared the results of their environmental impact analysis, which showed a potentially significant reduction in the impact of three greenhouse gases with implementation of the high-efficiency chiller system, specifically: carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced by 3,872,810 lbm/yr; sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduced by 1,052 gm/yr; and nitrous oxide (NOX) reduced by 3,449 gm/yr.\u000a\u000aIn seeking a solution that went well beyond simply replacing aging equipment, the engineering team developed a chiller strategy that takes advantage of the hotel's inherent load diversity: an open drive chiller system with variable-speed technology and a 10-to-1 turn-down ratio to save energy in partial-load operation.\u000a\u000aThe new system involved replacement of four existing VFD motors serving the cooling tower fans and space heating hot water pumps with four new 460V 3-phase ABB VFD motors (two 30-hp and two 40-hp). The new VFD drives were selected because they have BACnet capability to enable integration with a new HVAC controls and building automation system. EMCOR Services Mesa is a factory-authorized representative of ABB with factory-trained ABB start-up technicians. The team installed all of the components necessary to provide a variable pumping system for the central plant, including differential pressure transmitters, automatic control valves, flow meters, and Btu meters, which are required to support the variable pumping strategy.\u000a\u000aThe HVAC controls and building automation system were selected for monitoring and control of the central plant mechanical equipment. The new Schneider system utilizes BACnet open protocol networking that facilitates interoperability between different devices, such as VFDs, boiler controllers, and chiller controllers. The team developed the algorithm for the automation system to implement the variable sequence, as well as the graphical user interface. Building operators interface with the system utilizing a local graphical workstation and a standard internet browser from remote locations such as employee homes.\u000a\u000aThe team used three control strategies to maximize energy efficiency, facilitate more accurate and reliable control, and maintain guest comfort: DDC, chilled water reset, and hot water reset. DDC utilizes proportional, integral, and derivative action for optimum control speed and tight control accuracy. Chilled water reset reduces the demand on the chiller system by adjusting the chilled water set-point to a higher temperature based on demand and outside air temperature. Hot water reset reduces the demand on the boiler system by adjusting the heating hot water set-point to a lower temperature based on demand and outside air temperature. The boiler system can also be locked out based on outside air temperature.\u000a\u000aEMCOR Services Mesa provided project management for the mechanical retrofit and building automation system to facilitate coordinated project delivery. The company self-performed the engineering, mechanical system upgrade, ventilation/refrigerant monitoring system upgrade, building automation system, sheet metal, startups, and commissioning. Its partners performed the piping and electrical installations as well as crane and rigging work.\u000a\u000aHilton Los Angeles/Universal City's owner advisory board approached EMCOR Mesa to quickly solve a difficult problem. The owners had scheduled a ribbon-cutting ceremony for January 28 featuring a speech by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. The event included a 200-guest luncheon in the Sierra Ballroom. Unfortunately, the ballroom and its soaring 40-ft-high foyer had long been plagued by heating and cooling problems. The advisory board wanted to assure their guests' comfort at this salutary event.\u000a\u000aThe EMCOR Services Mesa team came up with a solution, expediting engineering, equipment selection, procurement and delivery, installation, and commissioning to ensure the event's success. The team isolated, demolished, and removed hot water piping to remove five existing VAV boxes and associated pneumatic control valves. The team provided and installed five new fan-powered VAV boxes with reheat coils, associated ductwork, and five new DDC hot water control valves; new hot water piping with shut-off valve, circuit setter, strainer, and connections to the new reheat coils; and associated electrical power. The team performed pressure testing, air and water balancing, and startup commissioning of the system and controls.\u000a\u000aDuring the event, EMCOR Services Mesa supported Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City Facility Manager Steve Thompson's presentation with a large-screen view of the building automation system's graphical user interface showing live operational and energy consumption data. Team leaders also led guests on a tour of the central plant.\u000a\u000aAfter a successful event, a member of the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City Hilton advisory board commented, "EMCOR saved the day for us." As a result, the owners asked EMCOR Services Mesa to develop mechanical and control solutions for another section of the ballroom, the banquet areas, front entry area, bar, and buffet areas.\u000a\u000aThe team finished its part of the project, completing it approximately two months ahead of schedule -- in just 110 days -- and within budget. A follow-up energy analysis performed by EMCOR Services Mesa Energy Systems after six months of operation demonstrated that the project is performing as projected.\u000a\u000aJust as a hotel's success in the hospitality industry is measured by the quality and value of its guests' experience -- requiring the hotel to deliver consistently flawless service and reliable comfort at a competitive rate -- so, too, is a mechanical services company.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam, enough to serve 1.3 million people annually.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) - Four companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind energy generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling project - if approved and financed - would create one of the country's largest wind farms 40 miles north of Cheyenne, a huge energy storage site inside caverns in a Utah salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe power - potentially twice the amount produced by the 1930s-era dam, enough to serve 1.3 million people annually - would be sent on to California through an existing 490-mile line.\u000a\u000aIt's success hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aThe California agency, anchored to 11 municipal utilities, delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers. It's seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy and power storage. Agency officials did not immediately return a call for comment.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to burning coal for electricity. The proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boom to the sleepy ranching town of 216 nestled below beige sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest under development in the U.S. is a 1,000-turbine site planned by Denver-based The Anschutz Corp. near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost - the government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year after flying into wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the companies' plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars has been invested in wind and solar projects. But finding an economical way to store energy has been a key issue given the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind or sun. Under the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using four caverns carved out of underground salt formations, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aWhen energy demand is low, excess electricity from the wind farm would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume.

VChina has suspended the import approval process for a genetically-modified soybean variety, citing "low public acceptance" of GMO food, according to two sources.\u000a\u000aIt is the first time that China's Ministry of Agriculture has cited public opinion as a reason for delaying approval of a GMO crop, the sources said.\u000a\u000aThe decision could fuel wider agribusiness concerns over an increasingly tough environment for GMO crops in China.\u000a\u000a"Previously if the Ministry of Agriculture decided not to approve a new product, it would be because of not enough data," said an executive with an industry association. The sources declined to identify the soybean variety involved. China accounts for about 60% of globally-traded soybeans.\u000a\u000aChina currently allows the import of eight genetically modified soybean products and 15 corn products, which are largely used in animal feed rather than food for human consumption.\u000a\u000aA GMO corn variety grown in the United States, Syngenta's MIR162, has not been approved for import by China, causing Beijing to turn away almost one million tonnes of US corn cargoes since November last year.\u000a\u000aAnalysts have linked the rejection to China's large domestic corn supplies, but GMO food is also struggling to win over public opinion after a series of negative media reports.

VBecause of weather conditions, the SpaceX International Space Station commercial resupply mission launch was delayed until Sunday. SpaceX\u000a\u000aThe SpaceX commercial resupply services, CRS-4, mission to the International Space Station was delayed due to rain, NASA reported. The U.S. space agency had scheduled the launch of the Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket for Saturday, but has rescheduled it for Sunday at 1:52 a.m. EDT.\u000a\u000a"Because of weather conditions that violated the rules for launching, SpaceX has postponed its planned launch of its Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft. It is SpaceX's fourth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station," NASA said in a statement. The Falcon 9 rocket was vertical on the launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida before the launch was scrubbed.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spacecraft will be carrying 4,885 pounds of cargo, including 1,380 pounds of crew supplies, as well as science experiments, technology demonstrations and the International Space Station Rapid Scatterometer, or ISS-RapidScat. The ISS-RapidScat will be mounted to the exterior of the space station and will bounce microwaves off the ocean's surface to measure wind speed.\u000a\u000aElements of the payload aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft will enable a multifaceted study of the Factors Contributing to Food Acceptability and Consumption, Mood and Stress on Long-Term Space Missions, or Astro Palate. To make a long story short, the study will explore ways dietary habits may be able to reduce the stress associated with space travel.\u000a\u000aAnother endeavor, the NanoRacks-Ames Fruit-Fly Experiment, will study the effect of space flight on oxidative stress, the buildup of harmful material in cells that can lead to disease.\u000a\u000aPossibly the most interesting piece of equipment to be flown to the space station this weekend is Made In Space Inc.'s 3D printer. The 3D Printing in Zero-G experiment "will use relatively low-temperature plastic feedstock to demonstrate that a 3D printer works normally in space, the first step toward establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, a critical enabling component for deep-space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing" (PDF).\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, NASA announced Tuesday SpaceX will receive a $2.6 billion contract to ferry astronauts to the space station, bringing manned launches back to the U.S. in 2017.\u000a\u000aYou can watch the NASA SpaceX launch live stream, beginning Sunday at 12:45 a.m. EDT. below:\u000a\u000aBroadcast live streaming video on Ustream

VThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced more than $518 million in new funding for rural electric cooperatives to improve the delivery of electric power to communities in 15 states. More than $23 million of the investment is targeted for smart grid improvements. According to the USDA, this funding is part of nearly $50 billion that the agency has invested in infrastructure improvements since 2009.\u000a\u000a"We must invest in America's infrastructure to promote sustainable economic development in our rural and urban communities," says Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. "Enhancements to the nation's electric grid make a huge difference for communities across the country and support President Obama's efforts to build a stronger rural economy."\u000a\u000aThe USDA says these latest loan guarantees will build or improve more than 5,600 miles of transmission line in rural areas. For example, New Mexico-based Springer Electric Cooperative will receive a $14.1 million loan to fund a 1 MW solar photovoltaic facility, 74 miles of line and other system improvements. The loan includes $518,400 for smart grid projects and $3.4 million for the renewable project. Meanwhile, Georgia-based Carroll Electric Membership Corp. will receive $20.6 million to build or upgrade 441 miles of line and devote $93,000 to smart grid technology.\u000a\u000aA complete list of the new loan recipients and projects receiving funding can be found here.

VFounded in 1984, InventHelp is working to submit the Sta-Pressed Hanger to companies in the hopes of a good faith review.\u000a\u000aIndividuals tire of having to iron their clothing every time they want to wear it, even when they seem to have just ironed it before. The Sta-Pressed Hanger helps to solve this problem.\u000a\u000aDeveloped by a pair of inventors from Rio Grande City, Texas, the modified hanger keeps larger clothing wrinkle-free. The design enhances organization in a closet. The device reduces the need to iron the garment before wearing it. It also saves the user from having to pay to get the clothing dry-cleaned a second time. The hanger ensures that the garment looks professional and neat. Furthermore, it offers added peace of mind.\u000a\u000aThe inventors' personal experience inspired their idea. "I often have difficulty keeping my clothing from getting wrinkled, even when it is hung on a hanger in the closet," one inventor said. "To make it so that I did not have to re-iron my garments before wearing them, I developed this better hanger."\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.

They will pioneer a commercial role in human spaceflight that was considered a radical change when a White House panel endorsed it in 2009, and the Obama administration proposed it in 2010.\u000a\u000aUSATODAY\u000a\u000aU.S.-Russia tensions on space station concern lawmakers\u000a\u000a"It represents a new way of doing business," said Wayne Hale, a former NASA shuttle program manager. "The principles are to maintain safety and reliability that we're all familiar with in this risky enterprise, but also to do it at a much reduced cost."\u000a\u000aNASA projects spending $3.4 billion over the next five years to develop and fly the new commercial crew systems (SpaceX's Dragon capsule, Boeing's CST-100 capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser mini-shuttle) -- slightly more than the agency will spend this year alone on the development of an exploration rocket and spacecraft, or that it spent on the shuttle's last full year of operations in 2010.\u000a\u000aHow much money Congress will actually provide, starting next year, remains uncertain. So NASA's first major decision is how many vehicles to continue funding.\u000a\u000aMost experts expect two winners. NASA has consistently said competition is key to producing the safest, most affordable systems, and it doesn't want to rely on a single provider in case that company runs into problems.\u000a\u000aBoeing and SpaceX appear on first blush to be the favorites, having been awarded twice as much money as Sierra Nevada in the competition's previous round in 2012.\u000a\u000aEach company must first prove it can meet NASA's voluminous safety requirements. Then, significantly, cost counts for about half of NASA's evaluation of the proposals.\u000a\u000aHere are some of each company's strengths and weaknesses:\u000a\u000aBoeing: An aerospace powerhouse that has participated in human spaceflight since its origins, Houston-based Boeing Space Exploration has received the most development money so far and may represent the safest pick politically.\u000a\u000a"Everybody knows the name Boeing," said former astronaut Leroy Chiao. "They're a big aerospace company, they know how to build spacecraft."\u000a\u000aKey to Boeing's pitch is its promise to assemble the CST-100 capsule in renovated former shuttle facilities at Kennedy Space Center and to base up to 550 employees here, probably adding the most local jobs.\u000a\u000aThe CST-100 is based on heritage systems that stress proven technology over innovation, but it has never flown in space. It would fly atop a United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, which has launched nearly 50 times.\u000a\u000aSpaceX: Its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule already deliver cargo to the International Space Station, and the Falcon 9, now with 11 successful launches, is the most affordable rocket available.\u000a\u000aSpaceX would launch crews from the space center's historic pad 39A, which it leased from NASA earlier this year, while the other two spacecraft would launch from the Atlas V pad next door at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\u000a\u000aUSATODAY\u000a\u000aBoeing hopes its crew capsule will replace shuttle\u000a\u000aSpaceX might find performing under a traditional NASA contract more difficult than the more flexible Space Act Agreements the program has utilized to date.\u000a\u000aFounder and CEO Elon Musk is revered in business and technology circles, but his brash approach has rankled some in the aerospace establishment and Congress.\u000a\u000a"I don't think SpaceX can be turned down, unless they find just a real major technical issue," said Roger Handberg, a professor at the University of Central Florida. "SpaceX is so publicly and politically potent right now."\u000a\u000aSierra Nevada: The Dream Chaser offers the field's only alternative to an Apollo-like capsule, a winged vehicle that looks and works more like a shuttle, and thus appeals to many at NASA.\u000a\u000aThe lifting body design, evolved from one NASA started years ago, provides some advantages over capsules, such as lower G-forces during re-entry and flexibility to land on runways across the country.\u000a\u000a"For the low Earth orbit job ... wings are perfect," said John Curry, Dream Chaser co-program manager, during a recent presentation to the Canaveral chapter of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association. "Capsules are not the way to do it, in my opinion."\u000a\u000aThe Dream Chaser also would lift off on an Atlas V. Sierra Nevada has already booked a November 2016 launch for an uncrewed orbital test flight.\u000a\u000aThe company's Colorado-based Space Systems division has built rocket engines, spacecraft components and satellites, but never an orbital spacecraft like Boeing and SpaceX have.\u000a\u000aBoeing and Sierra Nevada share a disadvantage that seemingly helps SpaceX: their Atlas V rocket depends on a Russian main engine at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are deteriorating.\u000a\u000aA Russian official's threat to stop providing the RD-180 engine for military launches seems less of a concern now, but SpaceX offers an option free of that uncertainty.\u000a\u000aThe upcoming decision is a big one for NASA and for many individuals such as Curry, who left NASA for a riskier opportunity to help lead a Dream Chaser team that he said could "do something spectacular."\u000a\u000aHe awaits the news confident Sierra Nevada has submitted a compelling spacecraft design.\u000a\u000a"The design of the vehicle is the best possible design that we can bring forward, and from that, I have peace," he said. "I'll let the chips fall as they may."\u000a\u000a6 CONNECT 9 TWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1u3Mry3

VA new survey out from the State Water Resources Control Board -- the first since emergency water conservation measures (like those $500 fines) were put into place in July -- shows that this past July Californians used 7.5 percent less water overall than they had used the previous July, reports KPCC. In the area that includes Los Angeles, as well as Ventura, San Diego, and Orange Counties, water use dropped by 1.7 percent. But then when you look at the list of which places had the biggest increases and decreases in usage, it quickly jumps out that SoCal is not pulling its weight -- nine of the 10 water suppliers with the biggest increases in usage were all in SoCal and the 10 suppliers with the biggest decreases were all in NorCal. (This continues a trend.)

VThe push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.

VLoading of commands for inserting India's Mars spacecraft into the Red Planet's orbit began on Sunday before noon and it will take about 13 hours to load these time-tagged commands into the spacecraft, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) officials said.\u000a\u000a"The exercise is progressing smoothly," they added. These commands will be used on September 24 for firing the Mars spacecraft's propulsion system, called 440 Newton engine, for 24 minutes to lower the spacecraft into an orbit around the planet. It will be a tricky manoeuvre as the engine has to sizzle with life on September 24 after it has idled for more than 300 days during its voyage in space.\u000a\u000aISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan earlier said that while "the primary objective" of India's Mars Orbiter Mission was to put the spacecraft into a Martian orbit, its scientific objective was empirical observation of the planet. The ISRO-built orbiter carries five instruments to detect methane on Mars, to study its geological activity, to study the Martian atmosphere and so on.\u000a\u000aISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle put the spacecraft into an initial orbit on November 5, 2013.

VCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON - The government will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers.

VFour companies today jointly proposed a first-in-the-U.S., $8-billion green energy initiative that would bring large amounts of clean electricity to the Los Angeles area by 2023.\u000a\u000aThe project would require construction of one of America's largest wind farms in Wyoming, one of the world's biggest energy storage facilities in Utah, and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting the two sites.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam - a landmark of the clean energy revolution," said Jeff Meyer, managing partner of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the four companies involved in the initiative.\u000a\u000aThe proposed project would generate more than twice the amount of electricity produced by the giant 1930s-era hydroelectric dam in Nevada - 9.2 million megawatt-hours per year vs. 3.9 million megawatt-hours.\u000a\u000aA key component of the project - a massive underground energy storage facility - would yield 1,200 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant and enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million L.A.-area homes.\u000a\u000aThe four companies - Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission - will formally submit their proposal to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015 in response to the agency's request for proposals to supply the Los Angeles area with renewable energy and electricity storage.\u000a\u000aThe underground energy storage facility would help solve one of renewable energy's biggest challenges - its intermittency. Wind farms produce no electricity when there's no wind; solar farms produce no electricity when there's no sun.\u000a\u000aLinking the wind farm to the energy storage facility would enable the wind farm to function largely like a traditional coal, nuclear or natural gas power plant - capable of reliably delivering large amounts of electricity whenever needed, based on customer demand.\u000a\u000aThe energy storage facility also would reduce the need for L.A.-area utilities to build expensive backup power plants and power lines to serve customers on days when there's no wind, at night when there's no sunlight, and during other periods when traditional wind and solar farms are unable to produce electricity.\u000a\u000aMedia teleconference today - 1 p.m. Eastern Time (10 a.m. Pacific)\u000a\u000aThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

VDENVER -- GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a press release touting the turbine ad that first aired on Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

VSpaceX launched a Dragon supply ship packed with mice, an experimental 3D printer, a hurricane research instrument, and a bundle of crew provisions on a two-day pursuit of the International Space Station with a thunderous middle-of-the-night sendoff from Cape Canaveral on Sunday aboard a Falcon 9 rocket booster.\u000a\u000aThe Falcon 9 rocket streaks into a starry sky over Cape Canaveral. Credit: SpaceX\u000a\u000aRunning a day late after Cape Canaveral was inundated with rain showers early Saturday, the experiment-laden Dragon spaceship lifted off at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT) after late night clouds dissipated, clearing a route for the 208-foot-tall Falcon 9 launcher to fly into orbit.\u000a\u000aA nine-engine first stage powered the Falcon 9 into a starry sky, generating 1.3 million pounds of ground-shaking thrust and an orange plume of rocket exhaust as the booster disappeared from view of spectators.\u000a\u000aAfter finishing a nearly three-minute burn, the first stage fell away to begin a series of maneuvers to fly back to Earth, heading for a controlled splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean in a technical experiment to help SpaceX make its rockets reusable.\u000a\u000aSpaceX has tried first stage flyback maneuvers on three previous launches, but Saturday's flight took off without landing legs, and officials predicted a low probability of the stage completing a successful water landing.\u000a\u000aThe Falcon 9's second stage took control to complete the primary task of Saturday's launch -- the deployment of the unmanned Dragon capsule on course to reach the space station Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spaceship separated from the launcher's second stage 10 minutes and 15 seconds after liftoff and extended its electricity-generating solar arrays a few minutes later.\u000a\u000aSpaceX officials said the Dragon capsule was in good shape after the launch and ready to begin a series of thruster burns over the next two days to reach the space station with more than 5,100 pounds of supplies, experiments and provisions.\u000a\u000a"Nothing like a good launch," said Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance and launch chief engineer. "It's just fantastic. We worked very hard yesterday and weather wasn't quite playing along and today everything was beautiful.\u000a\u000a"From what I can tell, at first glance, everything was really perfect," Koenigsmann said.\u000a\u000aEuropean Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst will take control of the space station's Canadian-built robotic arm to grapple the free-flying cargo carrier after it finishes a laser-guided final approach to the complex at around 1104 GMT (7:04 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe robot arm will maneuver the Dragon capsule to a berthing port on the space station's Harmony module, where the outpost's three residents will enter the supply ship's pressurized cabin to unload what's inside.\u000a\u000aThe cargo includes a transporter with 20 mice to probe how microgravity causes muscle atrophy, a 3D printer to demonstrate in-space component manufacturing, and a $26 million NASA instrument to measure winds over the world's oceans.\u000a\u000aAstronauts will transfer the mice into two habitats aboard the space station, with 10 mice in each enclosure.\u000a\u000aHalf the mice are sponsored by NASA to test out the effectiveness of animal handling procedures in orbit. A pharmaceutical company will study tissue samples from the other mice to help develop muscle atrophy treatments, according to NASA.\u000a\u000aTen of the mice will return in mid-October aboard the Dragon spacecraft, and the others are due to come back to Earth in December.\u000a\u000aFruit flies were also launched inside the Dragon capsule to study behavioral changes during spaceflight.\u000a\u000aA commercially-developed 3D printer, built by Silicon Valley startup Made in Space, is stowed aboard the Dragon spacecraft. It will be set up inside the space station to see if 3D printing is viable in microgravity.\u000a\u000aFunded in a public-private partnership by Made in Space and NASA, the 3D printer is the first device of its kind to ever launch into space. Engineers on the ground will uplink commands to the printer, giving it a 3D model of an object to build out of a stock of plastic carried inside.\u000a\u000aIf it works, 3D printing could help enable future space missions to distant destinations like Mars.\u000a\u000a"It's especially important when we consider human space exploration," said Niki Werkheiser, NASA's manager for the 3D printer project. "From day one, the supply chain has been very constrained. We have to launch every single thing we ever need from Earth, so being able to make what you need on orbit, when you need it, is a real game changer."\u000a\u000aNASA's wind-watching ISS-RapidScat instrument is bolted inside the Dragon capsule's external trunk section. Scientists say the sensor will help predict the strengthening of hurricanes in the tropics by tracking winds.\u000a\u000aOnce Dragon arrives at the space station, the lab's Dextre robotic handyman will pull the RapidScat instrument from the capsule's mounting pallet and place it outside the European Space Agency's Columbus module.\u000a\u000aOther gear to be delivered by SpaceX includes an experiment that could help improve the design of golf clubs, IMAX cameras, and two batteries to be installed into U.S. spacesuits ahead of a pair of spacewalks planned in October.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch kicked off SpaceX's fourth operational resupply run to the space station. NASA contracted with two companies, SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp., to send up supplies aboard privately-own space freighters after the retirement of the space shuttle.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's $1.6 billion deal covers 12 cargo missions through the end of 2016. With Sunday's liftoff, SpaceX has launched four of the dozen flights.\u000a\u000aBefore Sunday's launch, Koenigsmann said the cargo flight -- known as CRS 4 -- is establishing a more regular "cargo taxi" service to the space station.\u000a\u000a"The CRS 4 mission has become somewhat of a routine -- I would say a cautious routine -- because we have to be super careful that everything is reliable and working well and checked out and triple-checked again," Koenigsmann said before Sunday's launch.\u000a\u000aNASA announced Tuesday it selected Boeing Co. and SpaceX to ferry astronauts between Earth and the space station in the next phase of the agency's commercial spaceflight initiative, aiming for crew flights to begin by the end of 2017.\u000a\u000aThe commercial cargo craft flown by SpaceX and Orbital Sciences are crucial for the delivery of science experiments to the space station. Sunday's liftoff is the fourth commercial resupply flight by the two companies this year, with two more missions on tap before the end of 2014 -- an Orbital flight in October and another SpaceX launch in December.\u000a\u000aThis is the first year SpaceX's Dragon and Orbital's Cygnus spaceships have both been entrusted by NASA to ferry up critical supplies to the complex.\u000a\u000a"We've worked out a lot of bugs in the system, both on our side and on the vehicle processing, and both companies are learning along the way," said Dan Hartman, NASA's deputy space station program manager. "We're trying to keep our payload throughput up so we can support this increased cadence, but I think we're well on our way. We're looking forward to it quite honestly because stable access and stable return of our research is key."\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Dragon capsule is the only craft capable of returning large amounts of research specimens and hardware to Earth. Russia's Soyuz crew transporter can bring back limited cargo with its three human passengers, and other logistics spacecraft are designed to burn up and dispose of trash during re-entry.\u000a\u000aThe craft will depart the space station in mid-October, fire its thrusters to descend back into the atmosphere, and parachute into the Pacific Ocean with nearly 4,000 pounds of cargo for retrieval by SpaceX's recovery team.

VWASHINGTON -- The government will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75 day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after they were sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.

VWASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State and federal officials sought Tuesday to bring order to California's boom for renewable-energy plants in the Mojave and other southern California deserts, releasing a roadmap covering 22.5 million acres that designates some areas for large-scale solar, wind and geothermal plants and others for conservation of desert habitat and animals.\u000a\u000a"We have amazingly special places here," U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a news conference at a desert wind farm near Palm Springs with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and other officials releasing the multi-agency draft plan.\u000a\u000aBy taking a look at the desert as a whole, Jewell said, the plan's designers are ensuring "the areas that should be protected are set aside. The areas that should be developed are streamlined" for building utility-scale renewable energy plants.\u000a\u000aThe release of the plan follows a renewable-energy building boom in southeastern California's deserts during the first term of the Obama administration, when the federal government gave billions of dollars in loans to developers placing sprawling, utility-scale solar projects in virgin desert.\u000a\u000aThe plan released Tuesday recommends designating a total of 2 million acres as appropriate sites for future solar, wind and geothermal projects. Another 4.9 million acres under the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be set aside as conservation areas, if the draft plan is adopted.\u000a\u000aJewell's release of the plan opens a period of public comment through January. Renewable-energy developers and conservationists said they would be studying the more than 8,000 pages to learn exactly how areas were designated and under what rules.\u000a\u000aThe 22.5 million acres over seven southeastern California counties were "enough land for us to find a way to both protect species as well as find a way to develop renewable energy," Anne Baker of the renewable-energy industry's Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said after the plan's release. "We can figure this out."\u000a\u000aState and federal energy and wildlife officials created the draft plan for future projects after five years of consultation with conservationists, scientists and developers, American Indian tribes and others.\u000a\u000aCalifornia is on track to meet a state goal of having a third of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020.\u000a\u000aConservationists on Monday, in advance of the plan's release, pointed to the Ivanpah solar plant, opened in January on 4,000 acres near the Nevada border. The $2.2 billion solar plant displaced desert tortoises, compelling developers NRG Energy, BrightSource Energy and Google to spend more than $20 million to try to safeguard the tortoises, which the federal government has listed as a threatened species.\u000a\u000aThe plant, using a different form of solar energy than solar panels, also has proven unexpectedly deadly to birds that flew through its concentrated solar rays. NRG and BrightSource officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\u000a\u000aEnergy developers say environmental concerns have made building desert energy projects slower and more expensive than they should be.\u000a\u000a"There's a real urgency for getting projects up as quickly as possible," Mark Tholke, vice president of EDF Renewables energy company, said Monday, before the plan's release. "To meet the challenge of climate change ... we need cost-effective large projects."\u000a\u000aUp until now, conservationists say, the push for industrial-scale renewable energy projects in the Mojave did needless harm to desert species and habitat.\u000a\u000a"The emphasis was on developing massive projects on desert lands" with "little effort to minimize the impact," said Glenn Stewart, a biologist and a member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 5,000 pounds of NASA science investigations and cargo are on their way to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The cargo ship launched on the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 1:52 a.m. EDT Sunday, Sept. 21.\u000a\u000aThe mission is the company's fourth cargo delivery flight to the space station through a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract. Dragon's cargo will support experiments to be conducted by the crews of space station Expeditions 41 and 42.\u000a\u000aOne of the new Earth science investigations heading to the orbital laboratory is the International Space Station-Rapid Scatterometer. ISS-RapidScat monitors ocean winds from the vantage point of the space station. This space-based scatterometer is a remote sensing instrument that uses radar pulses reflected from the ocean's surface from different angles to calculate surface wind speed and direction. This information will be useful for weather forecasting and hurricane monitoring.\u000a\u000aDragon also will deliver the first-ever 3-D printer in space. The technology enables parts to be manufactured quickly and cheaply in space, instead of waiting for the next cargo resupply vehicle delivery. The research team also will gain valuable insight into improving 3-D printing technology on Earth by demonstrating it in microgravity.\u000a\u000aNew biomedical hardware launched aboard the spacecraft will help facilitate prolonged biological studies in microgravity. The Rodent Research Hardware and Operations Validation (Rodent Research-1) investigation provides a platform for long-duration rodent experiments in space. These investigations examine how microgravity affects animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may have direct impact toward human health on Earth.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spacecraft will also transport other biological research, including a new plant study. The Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware has supported a variety of plant growth experiments aboard the space station. The BRIC-19 investigation will focus on the growth and development in microgravity of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a small flowering plant related to cabbage. Because plant development on Earth is impacted by mechanical forces such as wind or a plant's own weight, researchers hope to improve understanding of how the growth responses of plants are altered by the absence of these forces when grown in microgravity.\u000a\u000aDragon is scheduled to be grappled at 7:04 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 23, by Expedition 41 Flight Engineer Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, using the space station's robotic arm to take hold of the spacecraft. NASA's Reid Wiseman will support Gerst in a backup position. Dragon is scheduled to depart the space station in mid-October for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja California, bringing from the space station almost 3,200 pounds of science, hardware and crew supplies.\u000a\u000aThe space station is a convergence of science, technology and human innovation that demonstrates new technologies and makes research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. NASA recently awarded contracts to SpaceX and The Boeing Company to transport U.S. crews to and from the space station with the goal of certifying those transportation systems in 2017.\u000a\u000aFor more information about SpaceX's fourth cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, visit:\u000a\u000aLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO

VAccess to renewable energy just got easier for individuals and business that use electricity in Denver. Officials from Xcel Energy, the EPA and the Colorado State Land Board joined community solar developer Clean Energy Collective to officially open Denver County's newest community solar facilities -- two state-of-the-art 500 kW solar arrays that make affordable, locally-made clean power available to all Xcel Energy customers, residential or commercial, in Denver County.\u000a\u000aDeveloped on a 5-acre site at the Evie Garrett Dennis School campus in northeast Denver, the two medium-scale solar PV arrays, consisting of more than 4,000 panels, are the eighth and ninth arrays CEC has brought online as part of Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Communities program. Combined, CEC's power contribution to the Xcel Energy grid is over 4 MW. CEC now operates 16 community solar projects in Colo.\u000a\u000aThrough the community solar model, any Xcel Energy ratepayer in Denver County can purchase individual panels in the shared arrays, from one kilowatt up to enough panels to off-set all of their electricity needs. Customers receive the same rebates and incentives as if the system were located on their property, and credit for the energy produced comes directly on their monthly Xcel Energy bill.\u000a\u000a"Broad accessibility is vital for any clean energy plan, yet it must make sense financially to the average person or business," says Paul Spencer, founder and CEO of CEC. "Community solar is a solution that combines both."\u000a\u000aAfter available rebates and tax incentives, the cost is $3.70 per Watt, or $906.50 per solar panel. The combined facilities are expected to produce approximately 1,668,000 kWh of clean energy per year, enough to power about 150 homes annually. Over the 20-year Xcel Energy agreement, CO2 omissions will be reduced by over 54 million pounds.\u000a\u000aFor other news on community solar, check out these articles:\u000a\u000aFirst County In Nation Powered by Community Solar\u000a\u000aNRG And Boeing Introduce 6MW Community Solar Facility\u000a\u000aSolarWorld Powers Grassroots Community Solar Coast To Coast

VA commercial SpaceX supply ship loaded with NASA experiments will have to wait at least one more day to blast off into space after bad weather stopped a launch attempt early Saturday.\u000a\u000aA drizzling pre-dawn rain and thick clouds hovered over Space X's launch pad, causing the company to postpone the Dragon delivery mission to the International Space Station for NASA until Sunday (Sept. 21), according to SPACE.com.\u000a\u000aThe Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon capsule will now launch at 1:52 a.m. EDT on Sunday.\u000a\u000a"We have scrubbed today's launch opportunity because of inclement weather," NASA spokesman Mike Curie said during the countdown commentary about a half hour before the targeted 2:14 a.m. EDT launch time on Saturday.\u000a\u000aClick here to watch the SpaceX launch webcast live on Sunday on Space.com, thanks to NASA TV. The webcast will begin at 12:45 a.m.\u000a\u000aOn Sept. 16, SpaceX won a $2.6 billion contract to design and fly Dragon passenger ships. A test flight should take place sometime in 2016, according to Reuters. NASA also awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop a second space taxi.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61 million, while Boeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150 million.\u000a\u000aSpaceX is owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk. The company already flies cargo to the ISS for NASA under a $1.6 billion contract and has a backlog of more than 35 commercial satellite and NASA resupply missions.\u000a\u000aThe current mission will bring up food, clothes and science gear for the station's crew. The Dragon freighter carries an experimental 3-D printer, a science instrument to monitor winds over Earth's oceans and 20 mice to be used in experiments, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aThe forecast for Sunday shows a 40-percent chance of good launch weather for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon, said NASA weather experts. The Dragon spacecraft should arrive at the station on Tuesday (Sept. 23) and be captured by astronauts using the outpost's robotic arm.\u000a\u000a"We're hoping the weather will be more favorable," Curie said.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown successfully 12 times.

VHistorically, spaceflight has been reserved for the very healthy. Astronauts are selected for their ability to meet the highest physical and psychological standards to prepare them for any unknown challenges. However, with the advent of commercial spaceflight, average people can now fly for enjoyment. The aerospace medicine community has had very little information about what medical conditions or diseases should be considered particularly risky in the spaceflight environment, as most medical conditions have never been studied for risk in space - until now.\u000a\u000aThe aerospace medicine group at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston recently studied how average people with common medical problems - high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, lung diseases like asthma or emphysema and back and neck injuries, surgeries or disorders - would be able to tolerate the stresses of commercial spaceflight. Overall, they found that nearly everyone with well-controlled medical conditions who participated in this project tolerated simulated flight without problems. The study can be found in the journal Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine.\u000a\u000a"Physiological stresses of flight include increased acceleration forces, or 'G-forces,' during launch and re-entry, as well as the microgravity period," said lead author Dr. Rebecca Blue. "Our goal was to see how average people with common medical problems, who aren't necessarily as fit as a career astronaut, would be able to tolerate these stresses of an anticipated commercial spaceflight."\u000a\u000aSome medical conditions are of particular interest within the commercial spaceflight industry, either because of the high rate of occurrence or because of the potential to cause sudden, serious medical events. The researchers studied how people with these common conditions performed when put through centrifuge simulations of spaceflight launch and re-entry.\u000a\u000aThe centrifuge allows researchers to mimic the acceleration of a rocket launch or of a spacecraft re-entering through the atmosphere. Astronauts regularly use centrifuges to train for their own spaceflights. The acceleration forces expected in a commercial spaceflight profile are tolerable, but can be uncomfortable, for healthy individuals. The researchers wanted to see if they were equally tolerable for individuals with complex medical histories or whether there were certain conditions that would make it more difficult for them to handle the flight.\u000a\u000a"This study further supports the belief that, despite significant chronic medical conditions, the dream of spaceflight is one that most people can achieve," said Blue.

VIn an effort to clean up America, the United States government seeks ways to transport tons of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants across the country to various nearby disposal sites.\u000a\u000aOr, wait, the government already has the trains; the trains just have nowhere to go and no cars to haul.\u000a\u000aSuch is the current nuclear dilemma the U.S. Department of Energy faces as they plead with national companies for ideas on how they can get more rail cars to transport each of the 150-ton casks of used, volatile, radioactive waste. They expect the cars could last 30 years but they want to know if consumers -- or maybe experts that don't already work for the government? -- think they should buy or lease the rail cars.\u000a\u000aWhether it is a lack of response or a lack of manpower, apparently the Obama administration isn't planning to move the trains anytime soon, even if they did have the cars. After all, the latest government plan is to build or use an existing interim storage site -- but not until 2021 -- as they wait for a new geologic depository that should be ready by 2048.\u000a\u000aWhether they are building a new geologic depository or plan to alter an existing site is also unclear at this time. And nobody knows where any of these sites could possibly be. Still, even amidst the confusion the Obama administration continues to plan, develop, write contracts, and test new equipment in anticipation that the answers will come.\u000a\u000a"Digging your well before your thirsty" really only works when you still have water to drink. Where are we going to put all the waste we already have?\u000a\u000aOf course, the U.S. Department of Energy hasn't commented on the issue, but they do share responsibility for disposing of the waste with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comission.

VATLANTA Federal officials are looking for train cars to haul nuclear waste toward its final resting place.\u000a\u000aToo bad they have no idea where that train will actually go.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the U.S. Department of Energy asked commercial firms this spring for ideas on buying or leasing specialized train cars to haul radioactive, used fuel from nuclear reactors to an interim storage site or a geologic depository. Those railcars will carry 150-ton casks of fuel up to eight times annually.\u000a\u000aU.S. officials began charging electricity customers years ago for handling the disposal of nuclear power waste. Plans for a disposal site have repeatedly bogged down.\u000a\u000aThe waste will likely move by rail because it's too heavy for trucks or even normal railcars.

VLOS ANGELES -- The push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by the Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.

VThe private space business is booming, and Texas is a primary launch pad. For this week's Friday Conversation, KERA's vice president of news, Rick Holter, sits down with Ed Lu - a longtime astronaut who now has his own space company.\u000a\u000aLu is the head of what's been dubbed the Sentinel mission, an effort to launch a private satellite that would track astronauts in the solar system that could someday threaten Earth.\u000a\u000a...on this moment in the space business: "Things are changing very, very rapidly and I think for the better. I think what we're finding is that private enterprise is being able to take over now some of the things that the government led programs, mostly by NASA, have only been able to do up until now. I think this is going to be good for the nation and good for NASA because NASA can concentrate things on the very bleeding edge, the very edges of exploration while we can begin to shift some of these other activities toward the private sector."\u000a\u000a...on his new endeavor, 'Sentinel': "We're going to be able to tell where every significant size object is in our solar system at any given time, out to the next century. And that turns out to be really important because there are about a million asteroids at our best estimate that could hit the earth. The interesting thing is that we've only discovered the orbits of less than one percent of those. And what Sentinel actually is, is an infrared space telescope. It's infrared because that's they way you find asteroids because asteroids are almost the color of charcoal, and space being black, it means you can't see them very well using telescopes."\u000a\u000a...on what he misses about being in space: "I miss the view, I miss the weightlessness, but I've got plenty of important things to do down here. I feel like this is the most important mission that I've ever embarked on."

VFew would dispute that NASA has been in turmoil since President Obama canceled the Constellation Program in 2010, or at least in a state of declining activity. Faced with a vague and undefined mission, inadequate funding, poor leadership, and mounting political tension with Russian, the country that's providing astronauts with transportation to and from the International Space Station - the future for NASA looks bleak.\u000a\u000aNASA engineer Don A. Nelson described potential, fundamental problems with the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle as such:\u000a\u000a"...which NASA is hyping as ten times safer than the space shuttle. There is no feasible technique to design the Orion capsule to be safer than the shuttle because its small size and parachute weight limitation prevents the installation of escape pods. Every Orion crew re-entry will be in an untested capsule." "There is a culture of optimism," Nelson continues, "where project forecasts are knowingly made too low with the expectation that the politicians will always increase their budget to provide jobs for their constituents. Unbiased technical oversight is virtually nonexistent within NASA. There is not a united NASA, as each center has its own agenda."\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Representative Bill Posey (R -- FL) introduced H.R. 1446, the Reasserting American Leadership (REAL) in Space Act, which would direct NASA to return to the Moon by 2022: "to develop a sustained human presence there in order to promote exploration, commerce, science, and U.S. preeminence in space as a stepping stone for future exploration of Mars and other destinations."\u000a\u000aOn June 24, 2013, the bill was referred to the House Subcommittee, but so far there has been no vote. There seems little hope of H.R. 1446 being enacted. NASA's mission remains in the hands of Obama, who seems more interested in golf than providing the space agency with a clear mission. However, NASA does not have time to wait on a president whose concern about these issues has been severely "under par."\u000a\u000aIt takes a long time to build a space program, and when the next administration comes along, it's likely things will change course yet again. In 2003 the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) pointed out that NASA's consistently low budget, the lack of interest from the Presidents and Congresses since the Apollo Program coupled with the lack of a coherent mission had severely limited the agency's ability.\u000a\u000aH.R. 1446 could restore a unifying mission to NASA and would give the United States a tangible and achievable goal in space, both in the short and long term. But most people are unaware H.R. 1446 even exists, and as it has evidently not even been debated since June of 2013, most members of Congress don't appear to even be aware of it. During the 17th Annual International Mars Society Conference held last month former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin stated bluntly, but accurately, that the United States is not a spacefaring nation. "The bottom line, for me, is that we have better stuff in museums than we have in operations today. I can't think of another technical discipline in which that statement would be true."\u000a\u000aIs NASA beyond hope? And if so, is the United States finished as a world power in space? There are new advancements every day in private-sector space flight. SpaceX and Orbital Sciences are launching payloads to the International Space Station on an impressively regular basis. Bigelow is close to launching its own inflatable space station. But those private ventures, though impressive, are mostly promissory notes. No manned Dragon spacecraft has yet flown. Bigelow's space station is still a glossy painting in a magazine just like innumerable paintings since the inception of the space program of hardware that has never come to pass.\u000a\u000aAnd none of the private companies stand a realistic chance of sending humans beyond low-Earth-orbit anytime in the near future. But then, neither does NASA. However, unlike a private corporation, NASA is not controlled by a CEO who makes all the decisions. National policy in space flight is ultimately controlled by the American people. The depressing state of our space program can therefore be attributed to the general lack of interest on the part of our own citizens. There was no national outcry when President Obama canceled Constellation, and therefore Congress made no priority of restoring it. America is, quite literally, getting the space program it deserves.\u000a\u000aNASA has failed because we have failed to make it a national priority. It's that simple.\u000a\u000aOf course our democracy is not dead. We can reverse course. We can put space back on the national radar. But it will take more than the core group of space enthusiasts who read Spaceflight Insider to make it happen. And is the general public interested? Or even informed? Not judging by the reactions of the country when Constellation was shut down. Some of the blame can be placed on the news media who devote virtually no attention to space activities. But then perhaps the news outlets would report more on space if the public asked for it. They have not.\u000a\u000aHas the U.S. lost its appetite for space? Is the U.S. even interested anymore in the future? Only time will tell. It's encouraging that for the first time in a decade, space-based motion pictures are appearing again, from Moon to Gravity to the upcoming Interstellar. People's interests are reflected in pop culture. But whether they're interested enough to pick up the political debate is quite another matter. If there was a direct correlation between public interest and politics, we might have had a mission to Mars in the late 1980s.\u000a\u000aThe inception of the space program and the ensuing race to the Moon were driven not by curiosity or the thrill of adventure or idealistic dreams of a better tomorrow...but by fear. The launch of Sputnik-1 in 1957 scared the Western world into aggressive competition with the "bad guys" in space. Once that fear faded, so did interest in space, except among a core group of aficionados.\u000a\u000aFor that reason, it might be the best thing that ever happened to our space program if China puts the next footsteps on the Moon. To paraphrase a comment attributed to racecar driver Niki Lauda in the 2013 film "Rush" - while we are certainly inspired by the actions of our friends - we seem to be driven even more - by those of our rivals.

VLOS ANGELES (AP) -- An alliance of four companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aIf approved and financed, the sprawling venture would produce clean power equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant by creating one of the country's largest wind farms near Cheyenne, a huge energy storage site inside Utah caverns and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc.

The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VATLANTA - The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor.

VTHE world's first 'solar powered' soldiers are just around the corner following a breakthrough by scientists at the Australian National University (ANU).\u000a\u000aThanks to fully flexible plastic 'SLIVER' solar cells developed at the Australian National University's Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, ADF soldiers have been wearing their own personal solar power packs to charge batteries and devices such as laptops.\u000a\u000aMuch of the equipment carried by the modern-day infantry soldier such as night vision goggles, radios, lasers and GPS systems requires heavy battery packs to power it.\u000a\u000aDiggers trialled the so-called Solar Integrated Power Systems (SIPS) for 72-hours under mission conditions with normal power demands.\u000a\u000aAccording to project development manager Igor Skryabin the system performed very well.\u000a\u000a"In overcast conditions the ANU flexible panels produced sufficient power to maintain battery charge. In sunny conditions the panels charged the batteries," Professor Skryabin said.\u000a\u000aDirector of the ANU Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Andrew Blakers, said the key to the wearable panels was the 'SLIVER' solar cell technology developed by ANU.\u000a\u000aProfessor Blakers told News Corp Australia that he hoped the wearable solar technology would be on the market within two or three years.\u000a\u000a"The system will require some further proving and then we will be looking for a company to implement it and handle the commercial side," he said.\u000a\u000aProfessor Blakers said that apart from the military the system would have broad application across the outdoors industry.\u000a\u000a'The weight of batteries is an issue with everyone working outdoors,' he said.\u000a\u000aProfessor Blakers said the key to the plastic SLIVER technology was the incredible power to weight and power to volume ratios.\u000a\u000aThe panels are thinner than cardboard and the system produces about 200 watts a kilogram.\u000a\u000a'The power to weight ratio of the flexible cells is twice as good as other glass panels.\u000a\u000a'Because they bend they are also quite robust and soldiers aren't exactly gentle so they need to be rugged and flexible.'\u000a\u000aProfessor Blakers said flexible plastic was the way of the future for solar technology because they can follow any surface including corrugated iron and they can be applied in circles as well.

Vmdsolar writes with news of a plan to move radioactive waste from nuclear plants. The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go. Putting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel. They won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048. No one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.

VOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by the Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000aCompany officials said the underground storage site could yield as much electricity as a large nuclear power plant, or enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million homes.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool.

Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000aFollow Ray Henry on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rhenryAP.

VAbstract: We investigate cooperative radar and communications signaling. Each system typically considers the other system a source of interference. Consequently, the traditional solution is to isolate the two systems spectrally or spatially. By considering the radar and communications operations to be a single joint system, we derive inner or achievable performance bounds on a receiver that observes communications and radar return in the same frequency allocation. Bounds on performance of the joint system are measured in terms of data information rate for communications and a novel radar estimation information rate parameterization for the radar.

VHelsinki, 2014-08-27 09:00 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\u000a\u000aCAVERION CORPORATION INVESTOR NEWS AUGUST 27, 2014 AT 10:00 EEST\u000a\u000aCaverion to provide a total technical solution for Arendal police station in Norway\u000a\u000aCaverion has been awarded an agreement worth EUR 3.2 million to supply heating and sanitation, ventilation and air conditioning, electricity, security and safety as well as automation systems for the new Arendal police station in South Norway. In addition to installing all technical systems in the property, Caverion will be responsible for design & engineering, project management and project execution.\u000a\u000aIn the project, Caverion acts as a subcontractor to the general contractor BRG. The developer of the real estate is the government owned company Statsbygg.\u000a\u000aThe property will be built according to passive house standards, which means it will be largely self-contained, requiring very little energy for heating and cooling.\u000a\u000a"Statsbygg has strengthened its environmental focus over the last few years. Presently, one third of the new buildings have been built to passive house standards or even higher standards," says project manager Arnold Pedersen from Statsbygg.\u000a\u000aPassive houses typically have energy needs of about a quarter of the norm compared to traditional buildings. The energy need can be reduced through numerous measures such as extra insulation, added density, good windows and energy-efficient technical systems. To contribute to the energy efficiency in the Arendal police station, Caverion will supply the property with hydraulic water pumps for heating and aggregates with rotary switches, which will recycle up to 80% of the heat.\u000a\u000a"Caverion always delivers flexible and energy-efficient solutions, taking into consideration the entire life cycle of the property, including its sustainable use. ClimaCeil, our patented ceiling element developed in-house, integrates all the technical systems needed in the building, including ventilation, electricity, data, telecom, sprinkler and central vacuum systems. It will provide the police station with on-demand control of air and temperature, maintaining the conditions inside the property according to individually set targets for energy use. For example one can set different heating and cooling parameters for the south and north parts of the building," says department manager, Caverion's department Project South, Mikal Klungland.\u000a\u000aThe new police headquarters will encompass 5,700 square meters and will house reception and detention areas, office spaces and meeting rooms, a shooting range, exercise facilities and locker rooms. There will also be parking facilities for police vehicles as well as for the public.\u000a\u000aThe project is scheduled to be completed in July 2016.\u000a\u000aAn illustration of the property can be downloaded at:\u000a\u000ahttp://imagebank.caverion.com/check_a.php?hash=30dc1cbfbc5451b2462c16a2fc380a41\u000a\u000aFor further information, please contact:\u000a\u000aCaverion Norge AS, Head of Communications, Roar Andersen, tel. +47 908 30 310, roar.andersen@caverion.no\u000a\u000aCaverion designs, builds, operates and maintains user-friendly and energy-efficient technical solutions for buildings and industries. Our services are used in offices, retail properties, housing, public premises, industrial plants and infrastructure, among other places. We aim to be a leading European provider of advanced and sustainable life cycle solutions. Our strengths include technological competence and comprehensive services, covering all technical disciplines throughout the life cycle of the property and industrial plant.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- Carrying a 3D printer and 20 mice, U.S. spacecraft Dragon blasted off Sunday, starting a four-week mission to the International Space Station (ISS).\u000a\u000aThe unmanned spacecraft, launched by private U.S. firm SpaceX, lifted off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, a live NASA TV broadcast showed.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 minutes later, the spacecraft separated from the rocket's second stage as planned.\u000a\u000a"The Dragon spacecraft has been delivered to orbit!" U.S. space agency NASA said in its blog.\u000a\u000aIt was Dragon's fourth cargo mission to the ISS. These four "operational cargo missions have made the spacecraft a regular visitor to the orbiting laboratory," NASA said.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon spacecraft carried 2.5 tons of supplies, science experiments and technology demonstrations, including critical materials to support 255 science and research investigations.\u000a\u000aOne of the new technology demonstrations heading into orbit is a 3D printer the size of a small microwave, which will be the first such device in space.\u000a\u000a"The hardware serves as a test bed for evaluating how well 3D printing and the microgravity of space combine," NASA said in a statement prior to the launch. "Its use in space signals a new era of off-world manufacturing."\u000a\u000aThe 3D printer, developed by commercial company Made In Space, can churn out plastic objects within a span of 15 minutes to an hour, the space agency said.\u000a\u000aA group of 20 mice are also aboard the spacecraft, the first time for Dragon to carry live mammals.\u000a\u000aNASA said the rodent research enables scientists to study the long-term effects of microgravity on mammalian physiology.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the spacecraft carried a science instrument called ISS-RapidScat to monitor ocean winds from the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aDragon will arrive at the ISS early Tuesday and return to Earth in mid-October for a parachute-assisted splashdown off the coast of southern California.\u000a\u000aDragon is the only operational spacecraft in the United States capable of returning a significant amount of supplies back to Earth, including experiments.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, a California-based company, currently holds a 1.6-billion-U.S.-dollar contract with NASA to fly 12 cargo missions to the ISS using the Dragon spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, the company won a 2.6-billion-dollar NASA contract to develop and fly a manned Dragon spacecraft by 2017.\u000a\u000aNASA also awarded Boeing a 4.2-billion-dollar contract to develop a second space taxi in the hope of ending the U.S. dependence on Russia in manned missions.

VRed Wing city officials and leaders of the Prairie Island Indian Community say they are unhappy with a recent Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruling that does little to resolve the ongoing dispute over storage of spent nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThe Prairie Island nuclear power plant is on the Mississippi River in Red Wing, and is adjacent to the Indian reservation.\u000a\u000aA story in the Rochester Post Bulletin says the NRC ruling:\u000a\u000a"...opens the door for on-site nuclear waste storage for 100 years or more. The language also lifts a suspension on licensing additional nuclear facilities even without the creation of a national repository for nuclear waste."\u000a\u000aNot good, says Red Wing City Council member Peggy Rehder, who has lobbied in Washington, D.C., on the issue, and wasn't surprised with the ruling\u000a\u000a"There's been a movement toward saying that spent fuel in dry cask storage is safer for a longer period of time," she said. "It's disappointing, but on the other hand, we're seeing movement in Congress toward getting spent fuel that's in storage in at a least an interim storage site."\u000a\u000aAnd Ron Johnson, president of the Prairie Island Indian Community's Tribal Council, said in a statement:\u000a\u000a"...the NRC affirmed a new rule and generic environmental impact statement that concluded that spent nuclear fuel -- some of the most dangerous and toxic substances known to mankind -- can be safely stored 600 yards from our homes indefinitely if no geologic repository is ever built. No other community sits as close to a nuclear site and its waste storage."\u000a\u000aAccording to the paper, Xcel Energy says it has "38 casks containing nuclear waste near Red Wing and is permitted to store waste in 64 casks when the current operating licenses end in 2033 and 2034."

VA more than 500-mile power line proposed by Duke-American Transmission Co. from Wyoming to Utah is part of a wind energy and energy storage plan designed to help wind farms overcome the fact that they operate only when the wind is blowing.\u000a\u000aThe project would transport energy generated by a Wyoming wind farm to Utah. There, a utility-scale compressed air storage system would store the energy until it is needed in California.\u000a\u000aThe $8 billion green energy project was developed in response to a request for proposals seeking renewable energy and energy storage to help meet power needs in the Los Angeles area.\u000a\u000aThe project includes $2.6 billion for the Zephyr transmission line proposed by Duke-ATC.\u000a\u000aThe 500-volt direct-current power line would connect a $4 billion Wyoming wind farm project with Utah, said Anne Spaltholz, a spokeswoman for Pewaukee-based American Transmission.\u000a\u000aThe compressed air storage facility being proposed by Magnum Energy would then store the energy in underground salt caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aPartners in the project said it would include construction of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy's 2,100-megawatt project -- one of America's largest wind farms -- as well as one of the world's biggest energy storage facilities in Utah, and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting the two sites.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam -- a landmark of the clean energy revolution," said Jeff Meyer, managing partner of Pathfinder, in a prepared statement.\u000a\u000a"The Wyoming wind is very strong day and night, but linking that to an energy storage facility enables that wind farm pretty much to function like a baseload power plant, so it can deliver a large amount of power whenever it's needed based on customer demand," Spaltholz said.\u000a\u000aThe project would generate more than twice the amount of electricity produced by the giant 1930s-era hydroelectric dam in Nevada -- 9.2 million megawatt-hours per year vs. 3.9 million megawatt-hours.\u000a\u000aThe partners plan to submit a formal proposal by early next year to the Southern California Public Power Authority, in response to the agency's request for proposals to supply the Los Angeles area with renewable energy and electricity storage.\u000a\u000aThe Zephyr was originally proposed by Duke-ATC to extend 950 miles and cost $3.5 billion.\u000a\u000aDuke-ATC has been planning the Zephyr project for several years. Pathfinder then "brought Magnum Energy into the fold about the possibility of developing this underground storage facility," Spaltholz said.\u000a\u000a"Ultimately what we're trying to achieve is getting this clean wind energy to market in California, so if this is a more viable alternative and it addresses the needs of California, then we would pursue this option," she said.\u000a\u000aA key component of the project, a massive underground energy storage facility, would yield 1,200 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant and enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million Los Angeles-area homes, the companies said.\u000a\u000aDuke Energy and ATC formed a joint venture several years ago to build and own transmission lines across the country. ATC is owned by the main utilities serving eastern Wisconsin; Wisconsin Energy Corp. would hold a 60% stake in American Transmission if its proposed $9.1 billion acquisition of Integrys Energy Group wins approval from state and federal regulators.

VLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Construction has begun on a $1 billion solar power generating station in the Mohave Desert that officials say will produce enough electricity to power about 80,000 California homes when it is completed in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe 250-megawatt project, dubbed Silver State South, will capture solar energy with panels spread across almost 4 square miles of federal land south of Las Vegas, according to a fact sheet obtained Friday from a First Solar Inc. representative.\u000a\u000aExecutives with Arizona-based First Solar and Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources put the cost of the project at $1 billion during a Wednesday ceremony with federal Bureau of Land Management chief Neil Kornze at the site off Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line.\u000a\u000aKornze said in a statement Friday that since 2009, the BLM has approved more than 50 renewable energy projects around the country.\u000a\u000a"The Silver State South Solar Project is another step forward in using clean and abundant energy resources to make energy and create good-paying jobs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, it would be the same size as the largest solar project in the state, a 250-megawatt plant that First Solar is building on Moapa Paiute tribal land along I-15 north of Las Vegas. That project broke ground in March.\u000a\u000aFirst Solar is building the Silver State South array adjacent to a 25-megawatt Silver State North project the company completed in 2012 on almost 1 square mile of federal land near Primm.\u000a\u000aA subsidiary of NextEra will own both plants.\u000a\u000aSilver State North was the nation's first large-scale solar power plant built on public land. It sells power to NV Energy for use in the Las Vegas area.\u000a\u000aSilver State South will provide power to Southern California Edison under a long-term contract.\u000a\u000a"Renewable energy sources such as solar power play an important role in the future energy mix in this country," Armando Pimentel, NextEra president and CEO, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with First Solar and Southern California Edison to make this project a reality."\u000a\u000aSeveral more solar power projects have been proposed in southern Nevada, where arrays are also under construction in the Eldorado Valley south of Boulder City and outside the Nye County seat of Tonopah.

VWASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday revised sweeping food safety rules proposed last year after farmers complained that the regulations could hurt business.\u000a\u000aThe new proposals would relax water quality standards and allow farmers to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.

VA rapidly increasing number of U.S. households are installing rooftop solar panels, and that's foreshadowing a wider debate over the future role of our traditional electric grid. Ironically, it is a debate we've already had.\u000a\u000aIn the 1880s, heralded inventor Thomas Edison was locked in a bitter battle with engineer and entrepreneur George Westinghouse over how this new invention of electric power should spread across the country, a battle commonly known as The War of the Currents.\u000a\u000aEdison invented the very concept of electric power distribution. He called for a decentralized, widely distributed power system with a bunch of small power plants providing low-voltage direct current (DC) electricity to nearby homes and businesses.\u000a\u000aWestinghouse, working with inventor Nikola Tesla, advocated the use of high-voltage alternating current (AC) from a centralized system of large industrial power plants transmitted out to a spiderweb of power lines connecting the entire country.\u000a\u000aWestinghouse, AC and the centralized system eventually won out. That's more or less the model of the grid we have used ever since. It is a stable, reliable, cheap system, currently threatened by rooftop solar.\u000a\u000aA little bit. Maybe. Eventually.\u000a\u000aRight now solar is one of smallest parts of our electricity system, but Ryan Pletka with the infrastructure consulting firm Black and Veatch, sees adoption trends going through the roof.\u000a\u000a"If you look at data on the growth rate of solar... it's almost a flat wall in terms of a spike," Pletka said.\u000a\u000aIt's as if Thomas Edison's original distributed power model is coming back from the dead to battle the Westinghouse system once again. There is even a resurgent call for more DC electrical supplies.\u000a\u000aAs we've reported, many utilities have been pushing back against rooftop solar, claiming it is an unreliable, intermittent, resource coming in at various voltages and competing on the same lines with their big power plant electricity. Utilities are lobbying in state capitals and in Washington D.C. to hold rooftop solar back and make it more expensive.\u000a\u000aBut consultants like Pletka are suggesting that utilities should jump into the solar game - lease panels, sell panels and embrace the change.\u000a\u000a"We feel the utilities are in a unique position in the industry where they can proactively respond to distributed generation, particularly solar PV [photovoltaic]," Pletka said.\u000a\u000aSome companies, like NRG Energy, are doing just this. NRG Energy operates in almost every state from New Jersey to Wyoming. It is not a utility, but is similar in that it has centralized, old-style power plants and sells that electricity to consumers. The company will also sell residential solar panels, it will lease them, whatever its customers want.\u000a\u000a"(We're) a power company of choice," said NRG Home Solar President Kelcey Pegler Junior.\u000a\u000aNRG has to compete with other power providers, unlike many utilities. That's part of why NRG feels more of a need to stay ahead of the curve on distributed solar.\u000a\u000a"By the time you recognize that technologies are disrupting, it's too late," Pegler said.\u000a\u000aDoug Arent works as Executive Director of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. It is his job to study future scenarios for the electric grid. He's an optimist, and said it doesn't have to be an us versus them, utility versus rooftop solar owner scenario.\u000a\u000a"It's a collective dialog about how do we collectively move that system forward," he said.\u000a\u000aHe thinks this conflict will work itself out in time, that eventually we'll have a hodge-podge of electricity sources: decentralized and centralized, DC and AC, Edison and Westinghouse.\u000a\u000aArent believes we'll still have the major grid, but towns will also have smaller microgrids they can rely on in emergencies, more homes will have battery storage to back up their rooftop solar panels and utilities will adapt to all of that.

VNecessary: something of fundamental importance.\u000a\u000aDesire: conscious impulse toward an object or experience that provides enjoyment or satisfaction in its attainment.\u000a\u000aI think we can all agree that water supplied to a family home is certainly a fundamental necessity.\u000a\u000aThe massive pipelines built to deliver purified water to our homes and businesses cost millions of dollars to build and millions more to maintain.\u000a\u000aIt's unfortunate that the City of Detroit, already making headlines as the largest U.S. municipality to file for bankruptcy, is once again in the news for simply trying to collect fees owed for delivery of water.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department should have done a better job of notifying residents when - and why - they would face shutoffs.\u000a\u000aThat oversight seems to have been corrected now that Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is in charge.\u000a\u000aPayment installment plans are in place for those who are behind in their water bills. Hopefully, this will assist those truly in need.\u000a\u000aYet, some critics are now saying the problem is that water and sewer bills are too high. In comparison with other metropolitan areas, that is not true.\u000a\u000aThe rates, set based on revenues versus costs, would likely be lower if more Detroit customers paid their bills.\u000a\u000aReports show that only half of all Detroit customers are up to date with payments. That means 85,000 customers aren't paying.\u000a\u000aMost of the surrounding suburbs supplied with water from Detroit don't have a significant problem with scofflaws.\u000a\u000aBut Detroit is different, primarily because its residents discovered long ago that if they ignored a water bill absolutely nothing happened.\u000a\u000aThere were no water shutoffs and in most cases not even a threat of action.\u000a\u000aBut also at fault is the mindset of most that placed desires above the necessity of water.\u000a\u000aWhile those 85,000 families weren't paying for water, two-thirds managed to keep up with their cable TV bills and nearly three-quarters were finding money for monthly payments for cell phones.\u000a\u000aAt least part of the problem is that the water scofflaws don't know the difference between what is necessary and what is desired.\u000a\u000aWhat if a family dropped cable TV to pay for water? Would that be so terrible?\u000a\u000aKen Kish, a retired editor and contributing columnist, may be reached at

VThe power -- potentially twice the amount produced by the 1930s-era dam, enough to serve 1.3 million people annually -- would be sent on to California through an existing 490-mile line.\u000a\u000aIt's success hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aThe California agency, anchored to 11 municipal utilities, delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers. It's seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy and power storage. Agency officials did not immediately return a call for comment.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to burning coal for electricity. The proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boom to the sleepy ranching town of 216 nestled below beige sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest under development in the U.S. is a 1,000-turbine site planned by Denver-based The Anschutz Corp. near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost -- the government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year after flying into wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the companies' plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars has been invested in wind and solar projects. But finding an economical way to store energy has been a key issue given the fluctuating nature of power generated by wind or sun. Under the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using four caverns carved out of underground salt formations, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aWhen energy demand is low, excess electricity from the wind farm would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators, the statement said.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAP Energy Writer Jonathan Fahey in New York contributed to this report.

VSpaceX's Falcon 9 spacecraft, with the Dragon reusable capsule [AFP]\u000a\u000aAn unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to deliver a cargo ship to the International Space Station for NASA.\u000a\u000aThe 208-foot (63-meter) tall booster, built and launched by privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, bolted off its seaside launch pad at 1:52 a.m. EDT/0552 GMT, slicing the night-time sky with a bright plume of light as it headed into orbit.\u000a\u000aTen minutes later, the Dragon cargo capsule perched on top of the rocket was released to begin a two-day journey to the space station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth.\u000a\u000aThe spaceship is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of equipment, supplies and science experiments, including 20 live mice for medical experiments, a prototype 3-D printer and an instrument to monitor ocean wind speeds.\u000a\u000aThe mission, which was delayed one day by poor weather, is the fourth under the company's 12-flight $1.6 billion NASA contract for cargo delivery services.\u000a\u000aSunday's launch was the second in two weeks for California-based SpaceX, the fastest turnaround between missions since Falcon 9 rockets began flying in June 2010.\u000a\u000a"We are ramping up for that launch rate, and actually even more than that," Hans Koenigsmann, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) vice president of mission assurance, told reporters at a prelaunch news conference.\u000a\u000aThe company has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth nearly $5 billion, on its manifest, said SpaceX spokesman John Taylor.\u000a\u000aLast week, SpaceX won a second NASA contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to upgrade and fly its Dragon capsules for astronauts - and potentially paying tourists as well. A crewed Dragon spaceship is targeted for a debut test flight in 2016.\u000a\u000aNASA also awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop and fly a second space taxi. The price difference is primarily the cost of the launcher. [ID:nL1N0RI2XY]\u000a\u000aSpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets sell for about $61 million. Boeing plans to buy Atlas 5 rockets, which cost about $150 million. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, manufactures and sells Atlas 5, which predominantly are used for U.S. military missions.\u000a\u000aSpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, is gunning for that business as well. A lawsuit is pending in federal court contesting the U.S. Air Force's latest non-competed award to United Launch Alliance.\u000a\u000aSo far, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have flown 13 times, all successfully.\u000a\u000aDragon is due to reach the space station at 7:04 a.m. EDT/1104 GMT on Tuesday.

VCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aDENVER - GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a news release touting the turbine ad that first aired Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000aOnline\u000a\u000aGardner's Next Generation Energy ad: http://bit.ly/1qdgy63\u000a\u000aCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

V2 CONNECT 1 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000a2 CONNECT 1 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

VThe build-up has been killing us, the very first 3D printer to make its way out of the earths atmosphere was scheduled to take off early this morning. I imagined waking up at dawn, to images of a successful launch and eventually hearing about the docking at the International Space Station (ISS) where the Made in Space Zero-G 3D printer would begin a manufacturing process, which is literally out of this world.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, there was a bit of a let down this Saturday morning. There was no launch, there is no 3D printer in space, and the commencement of the 3D printing process will likely be pushed back by at least a day.\u000a\u000a"The launch director and team have made the determination to scrub today's launch attempt," Mike Curie, NASA launch commentator reported.\u000a\u000aThe reasoning? Weather. Living in Florida myself, it's been quite wet these last 24 hours or so, with rain continuing this morning. NASA decided to not take any chances, and instead has push the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Dragon spacecraft back to tomorrow morning instead. The new launch time will be 1:53 a.m. EDT on September 21, provided the weather cooperates, which according to Weather.com, there is a very slight (0-10%) chance of rain around that time. Fortunately, the storm system which has been bringing all the wet, dreary weather to the Sunshine State is slowly pushing away.\u000a\u000aThe SpaceX 4 Commercial Resupply Services flight with ISS-RapidScat mission will be bringing cargo weighing approximately 5,000 pounds to the ISS. In that cargo, of course is the Zero-G 3D printer which NASA hopes to be the beginning of a program designed to manufacture tools and components in space, reducing future payloads. They also hope that this research will eventually lead to their ability to 3D print structures on other worlds such as Mars.\u000a\u000aFor those of you wishing to watch the launch live, NASA is making this possible. The countdown coverage will commence at 12:45 a.m. EDT on both NASA's launch blog and on NASA TV. Stay up to date on the launch, as well as the eventual 3D printing which will be taking place in the days and weeks ahead, in the NASA 3D Printer forum thread on 3DPB.com

VSpaceX's Dragon capsule was launched Sunday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying some 2,300 kilos (2.5 tons) of experimental equipment and supplies for the astronauts on board the International Space Station, or ISS.\u000a\u000aThe launch of the Falcon 9 rocket came at 1:52 a.m., although the Dragon capsule itself will need about two days to travel up to - and dock with - the ISS.\u000a\u000aThe cargo on board the Dragon includes a 3D printer, a radar to study hurricanes and 20 mice, the first mammals to travel on board the space supply vehicle.\u000a\u000aThis is the first flight by SpaceX to the ISS after NASA announced it had awarded the firm and Boeing a contract worth almost $7 billion starting in 2017 to transport U.S. astronauts into space, something that - since the space shuttle program came to an end in 2011 - has been done using Russian Soyuz capsules.\u000a\u000aSpaceX has already flown four resupply missions of the 12 agreed to with NASA in a contract worth $1.6 billion.\u000a\u000aThe launch and placement into orbit of the Dragon capsule was carried out as scheduled and without incident.\u000a\u000aCurrently, there are six people on board the ISS: Russian cosmonauts Maxim Suraev, Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova, U.S. astronauts Barry Wilmore and Reid Wiseman and Germany's Alexander Gerst.

VNotwithstanding the farcical goings on around the RET review, solar businesses in Australia continue to move and shake.\u000a\u000aIts seems the last few months have been all about mergers and acquisitions which is either a sign of industry maturity or desperation, depending on your perspective. One thing that is clear is that in turbulent times and with the prospect of lower demand, consolidation of players should help strengthen our industry.\u000a\u000aSolco/Go Energy\u000a\u000aAccording the ASX announcements, long standing industry player Solco has continued its evolution by announcing that it intends to acquire a collective group of companies referred to as the Go Group from Urban Group Energy Holdings Pty Ltd.\u000a\u000aThis is an intriguing move by Solco, who, by getting hold of a package of retail licences, PPA models and more can potentially leapfrog into the emerging but as yet largely untapped market for "innovative electricity retailers". Solco started out decades ago as a small solar retailer and wholesaler in southern Queensland so the mere fact that they are still alive, kicking and active is an outstanding result in itself.\u000a\u000aUrban Group of Holdings are another beast altogether who are a diverse group but have been increasingly active and bullish in PV since kicking off in 2010 and describe themselves as "a parent group to five separate yet complementary companies". They have had a crack at pretty much every strategy in solar; wholesale (ultimately leading to a partnership with SolarJuice), retail (through a stake in retailer BioSolar), manufacturing (through their initial investment in Sungrid) and energy retailing through new entity Go Energy. Just what their strategy or position is is hard to keep track off, especially give that a Managing Controller was appointed to BioSolar last month (according to ASIC) and rumours are that many of their almost 200 staff have been let go.\u000a\u000aEnergy Matters/SunEdison\u000a\u000aArguably the most fascinating story to emerge recently is the take over of solar retailer and industry stalwart Energy Matters by global PV powerhouse SunEdison. Details are sketchy but according to our sources, the deal has been inked and details of what this means will follow soon. What I like about this deal is that Energy Matters have built a very cool solar business with some good runs on the board, lots of diversity and some real innovation behind the scenes. But of course, its tough at the top and my intuition tells me that this takeover could be pretty timely.\u000a\u000aI also like this one because SunEdison are just friggen massive; likely astounding huge. They have been working hard in Australia just quietly working out how and where to play and this announcement is clearly a big step from talking to getting rolling and I think that can only be good for the industry and consumers.\u000a\u000aMPower/Ingenero\u000a\u000aWhilst the loss of Ingenero (who collapsed recently) was a sad day due to their solid reputation and some talented staff, out of the ashes it seems the phoenix may rise. MPower, who are part of the ASX listed TAG Pacific group announced this week that it had acquired certain assets out of the Ingenero group, which lead to them being awarded a construction contract with First Solar for the 1.7MW Weipa project. Word onthe street is that many Ingenero's former staff have moved over to MPower, bolstering their strength and providing good potential for expansion into the large scale project market .\u000a\u000aMPower have struggled a little lately, according to their annual report but a fresh new look and apparently, an enthusiasm to move very quickly into new opportunities could bode well for them and the industry. Tag Pacific's share price spiked on the back of the announcement.\u000a\u000aOthers\u000a\u000aWhilst these major public announcements are a sign of change at the big end of town, there are also structural and ownership changes going on which are less obvious. Growth, survival and changes in equity are all pretty normal in industry and our multi billion dollar a year solar industry is not immune. Outside the direct solar space, we also learned that finance company CAFGA which have been very active in the solar space in recent years are now part of Evergreen Finance, demonstrating that consolidation is alive across the value chain. Expect to see new announcements around ownership and equity on more major players soon.\u000a\u000aThere is also ongoing consolidation at the smaller end of the solar industry although the pressure is arguably more acute there. For the average solar company doing 3 or 4 installs a week, the crippling effects of the RET Review induced market uncertainty are very real. Although there is a a palpable spike in demand right now, reports are coming in on a daily basis that many solar companies are simply giving up. We don't have a handle on the numbers yet but would suggest that perhaps 5 companies a week are succumbing to the pressure.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, some smaller companies are taking a different approach and looking for investors and others have successfully managed to sell their businesses in the past few months. Its a tough time to realise maximum value and I have also witnessed first hand how some sellers are so desperate, they are quite happy to hide debt and unpaid bills then run for the hills. Must get that bad debtor insurance organised to avoid more losses - I wonder if they have a category for "solar shonks"?

VLos Angeles -- The push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015. [Duke Energy is part owner of Duke-American Transmission.]\u000a\u000a"Duke-American Transmission proposes to build the $2.6-billion, 525-mile, high-voltage electric transmission line that would transport the Wyoming wind farm's electricity to the Utah energy storage facility," Duke said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"The transmission line - a shorter alternative to Duke-American Transmission's previously proposed 850-mile Zephyr transmission project - would traverse Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, with a target in-service date of 2023."\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by the Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.\u000a\u000aCompany officials said the underground storage site could yield as much electricity as a large nuclear power plant, or enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million homes.

V23 CONNECT 9 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\u000a\u000aRoughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments are on their way to the International Space Station after a successful 1:52 a.m. blastoff by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon is expected to take two days to chase down the station, arriving around 7 a.m. Tuesday. A three-person crew will snare the free-floating spacecraft with a 58-foot robotic arm and attach it to a docking port for a month-long stay.\u000a\u000aAmong the cargo are 20 mice that are the first mammals to fly aboard the Dragon, part of a new rodent research program on ISS; the first 3-D printer in space; and a radar instrument that will improve hurricane forecasts.\u000a\u000aThe resupply mission is the fourth of 12 planned by SpaceX under a $1.6 billion NASA contract.\u000a\u000aSpaceX last week won a $2.6 billion contract from NASA to launch astronauts to the outpost in an upgraded Dragon, by 2017.\u000a\u000aThe launch came on the mission's second attempt, after weather scrubbed the first try Saturday.\u000a\u000aSunday's forecast started out iffy but improved to near-perfect conditions within an hour of the instantaneous window at Launch Complex 40.\u000a\u000aA quiet countdown culminated with nine Merlin 1D engines igniting with 1.3 million pounds of thrust and the 208-foot rocket rumbling northeast over the Atlantic Ocean trailing a comet-like streak of flame.\u000a\u000aMore than four minutes into the flight, the receding upper stage was still visible as a pinpoint of orange light amid a smattering of stars. Cameras showed the Dragon separate from the rocket less than 10 minutes after liftoff and then deploy its power-generating solar arrays.\u000a\u000aSpaceX planned to try to fly the first-stage booster back to a soft ocean landing in another test of reusable rocket technology, though it did not expect to recover the booster intact.\u000a\u000aThe launch was the 13th by a Falcon 9, and SpaceX's second from the same Cape pad in two weeks. following its Sept. 7 launch of a commercial satellite. That's the company's fastest turnaround between launches yet and close to a record at the Cape, according to a company official.\u000a\u000aSpaceX's next launch of ISS cargo is tentatively planned in December. SpaceX may have one other launch planned this year and also hopes to perform a test of the Dragon's launch abort system, a key system for future crewed flights, here before the end of the year.\u000a\u000a23 CONNECT 9 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1uqH0ba

VThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House.

VSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California and the federal government on Tuesday released an ambitious plan to accelerate the building of large renewable energy projects in the state's sun soaked desert while setting aside millions of acres for conservation in its latest bid to combat climate change. The goal of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan is to identify areas ripe with renewable energy potential that would also have minimal impact on species like the desert tortoise. The plan hopes to spur the development of up to 20,000 MW of power from renewable energy sources like sol...

VWASHINGTON -- The government will rewrite sweeping new food safety rules after farmers complained that earlier proposals could hurt business, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe FDA's new proposals would allow farmers to meet water quality standards more easily and to harvest crops sooner after using raw manure as fertilizer.\u000a\u000aThe FDA offered the revised rules Friday, and the final rules are due next fall. The FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules proposed last year would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would lower some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe rules would mark the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe food safety law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical, saying small farms can't afford the new standards.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in some of the recent outbreaks.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food (CFSAF) today applauded Representative Tom Petri (R-WI-06) for cosponsoring the bipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which will establish national labeling standards for food and beverage products and eliminate the potential confusion and bureaucratic, costly red tape stemming from a 50-state patchwork of laws and regulations that could raise the could cost of food.\u000a\u000a"In sponsoring The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, Representative Petri is taking an important stand on behalf of consumers, food safety and science," said Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food. "American families deserve access to safe and affordable food, and this legislation will ensure that important food safety and labeling decisions are made by scientists, not political activists."\u000a\u000aThe Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act would prevent duplicative labeling, increased transportation costs, unnecessary product warehousing, burdensome product segregation plans and highly inefficient transportation requirements. A state-by-state patchwork of labeling laws would not advance food safety, inform consumers, or provide consistency in labeling.\u000a\u000a(According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 95 percent of Wisconsin's soybean farmers and 92 percent of its corn farmers rely on GMO technology to consistently and economically grow their crops, using fewer pesticides, less water and more efficient use of their land. That translates into affordable food for consumers on the supermarket shelves.)\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the legislation reaffirms the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as America's sole authority on food safety and labeling requirements; requires the FDA to approve all new GMO ingredients before they are brought to market; sets a federal standard for the labeling definition of "natural;" and establishes federal standards for companies that wish to voluntarily label their products for the absence-of or presence-of GMO food ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe most influential food safety regulatory agencies and organizations around the world, including the FDA, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that GMOs are as safe as any other foods. In addition, studies have shown that unnecessary GMO labeling would increase costs for the average family by approximately $400 per year.\u000a\u000aThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is a broad-based coalition representing the entire American agriculture food chain - from farm to fork. CFSAF is committed to increasing understanding about the science and safety of GM technology and to advocating for a federal labeling solution.

VDENVER GOP Senate candidate Cory Gardner, framed by sunflowers and wind turbines, tells voters in a campaign ad this week that he co-wrote a law to launch Colorado's green-energy economy. He leaves out that the law was repealed five years later, deemed useless for not enabling a single project.\u000a\u000a"Gardner's claiming credit for launching Colorado's clean-energy economy and he did not. Coloradans did that and Coloradans deserve the credit," said Chris Harris, spokesman for incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. Udall's camp has been deriding Gardner's wind-turbine ad and the Republicans' touting of the 2007 law.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Energy Development Authority, which was set up by the law, was intended to assist in the financing of clean-energy projects such as improvements to electricity transmission lines. It came three years after voters made Colorado the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard.\u000a\u000aAt the time the law was passed Gardner was a member of the Colorado House. He was elected to the U.S. House in 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a press release touting the turbine ad that first aired on Monday, Gardner's campaign cited a 2007 speech by then-Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, who predicted the Gardner bill would "solve one of the biggest challenges when it comes to clean energy."\u000a\u000aBut the authority had financing caveats that made it toothless, said Tom Plant, who oversaw the authority from its creation until 2011 as head of the Governor's Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"He introduced the legislation in good faith in order to do something," Plant said this week of Gardner. But he said the authority's funding mechanism "made it impossible for us to ever issue bonds."\u000a\u000aThe authority never had a staff and did little but gather once a year to report to the legislature that it had made no progress. By 2012 the authority was scrapped, part of a larger makeover of the Energy Office, now called the Colorado Energy Office.\u000a\u000a"There's no point in having something that can't do anything," said Plant, now a policy adviser at the Center for the New-Energy Economy at Colorado State University. The center is run by Ritter, who set up the Governor's Energy Office and appointed Plant to run it.\u000a\u000aGardner's spokesman insisted that the authority was a valuable addition to Colorado's progress toward energy efficiency.\u000a\u000a"In Washington, career politicians like Sen. Udall are fond of killing progress by faulting it for being imperfect. That's one reason nothing gets done," spokesman Alex Siciliano wrote in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe ad talks up more than the 2007 financing bill. It also mentions Gardner's ongoing support for wind energy, including his backing of tax incentives for the industry.\u000a\u000aGardner was invited to a 2013 White House Council on Environmental Quality gathering and has opposed GOP efforts to strip funding from the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt\u000a\u000aGardner's Next Generation Energy ad: http://bit.ly/1qdgy63

Look no further than the VISUAL EXTENDER.\u000a\u000aDeveloped by an inventor from Sayreville, N.J., the device extends the visual capacity of the eyes. The accessory enables the user to see and view where the eyes cannot reach. This allows for close examination of the peripheral parts of the body, such as the back, scalp, interspaces of the toes, etc.\u000a\u000aIt also enables the user to view the cavities of the body (oral, nasal and ear cavities, anal cleft, etc.). The unit saves time and money by reducing the need to schedule doctors' appointments as often. Additionally, it facilitates communication with medical professionals.\u000a\u000aThe inventor's personal experience motivated her idea. "I got my last maxillary molar extracted last year because it had a cavity," she said. "Two months ago, I felt like another tooth was protruding through my gum. I tried so hard to view it in the mirror, but it didn't work. That's when I got this idea."\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the New Jersey office of InventHelp.

VToronto: Despite what appears to be an insurmountable problem, researchers have found that it is possible to turn the situation around and significantly reduce water scarcity in just over 35 years.\u000a\u000aWith strong commitment and strategic efforts such as increased water-recycling and improved irrigation techniques it is possible to achieve the above objective, the study indicated.\u000a\u000a"Significant reductions in water-stressed populations are possible by 2050," said co-author Yoshihide Wada from Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aWater stress occurs in an area where more than 40 percent of the available water from rivers is unavailable because it is already being used.\u000a\u000aThe researchers separated strategy areas for reducing water stress into "hard path" measures, involving building more reservoirs and increasing desalination efforts of sea water, and certain "soft path" measures.\u000a\u000aThe soft path involves focus on reducing water demand rather than increasing water supply with the help of community-scale efforts.\u000a\u000a"There is no single silver bullet to deal with the problem around the world," said co-author professor Tom Gleeson from McGill University in Canada.\u000a\u000a"But, by looking at the problem on a global scale, we have calculated that if these strategies are applied at the same time we could actually stabilise the number of people in the world who are facing water stress," Gleeson added.\u000a\u000aWater stress currently affects about a third of the global population, and may affect as many as half the people in the world by the end of the century if the current pattern of water use continues.\u000a\u000aThe study appeared in the journal Nature Geoscience.

VWashington - A faster, cheaper way to manufacture silicon solar cells, partially funded by the Energy Department and fine-tuned at its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has won a coveted R&D 100 award as one of the top technology innovations of 2013.\u000a\u000aCrystal Solar's approach to growing high-quality, high-efficiency silicon wafers at 100 times the usual throughput and half the cost could be a game-changer, creating American jobs and stemming the flow of solar cell manufacturing overseas, says T.S. Ravi, chief executive officer of the Santa Clara, California-based company.\u000a\u000aEven before he founded Crystal Solar, Ravi set a goal to speed up the manufacturing process. In 2011, his nascent company applied for the Energy Department's SunShot Initiative's Photovoltaic (PV) Incubator Program, which at that time was run out of NREL. The PV Incubator Program has a very competitive selection process, searching for ideas that are truly disruptive in terms of lowering costs.\u000a\u000a"We applied for the program and were selected in late 2011," Ravi said, recalling a conversation he had several years ago with NREL's Harin Ullal. "I knew that if I could bunch a lot of wafers together, and find a way to remove the epitaxial wafer with a simple mechanical process, it could actually change the game in the solar industry."\u000a\u000aCrystal Solar's direct gas-to-wafer method is epitaxial, which means it grows a layer of material on top of another material that has the same crystal structure. In the direct gas-to-wafer method -- the official name is Direct Monocrystalline Silicon Wafer Growth by High-Throughput Epitaxy -- gaseous layers of semiconducting silicon material are grown directly on reusable silicon substrates. The method has several advantages, including eliminating the waste incurred in the traditional approach, which involves sawing thin slices from a large ingot or block of silicon. In the new approach, wafers can be made thinner without compromising their quality or efficiency.\u000a\u000aHowever, semiconductor material using the epitaxial approach typically grows very slowly -- about two wafers an hour for the thickness needed for solar wafers. That's much too slow -- and therefore costly -- for solar cells. The Energy Department's SunShot Initiative has set a goal for solar energy of less than $1 per watt system price by 2020, as a way of making it cost competitive with fossil-fuel-based electricity.\u000a\u000aIncubator program at NREL helped drive the technology\u000a\u000aCrystal Solar worked closely with NREL into 2013. "NREL pointed us in the right direction," Ravi said. "All these things we wanted to prove -- that we could grow these wafers at a high growth rate, that we could do it without compromising the quality of the wafers -- required the silicon defect expertise at NREL."\u000a\u000a"We helped them understand the nature of the defects and thus improve performance at the wafer and cell level," said NREL Principal Scientist Bhushan Sopori, who, along with Ullal and NREL's Steve Johnston, worked with Crystal Solar on the process.\u000a\u000aUllal noted that the efficiency of the rapidly made cells is greater than 20% in the lab, so once in panels on rooftops, they should compare favorably to the best solar modules being installed today. "The SunShot PV Incubator Program is very competitive," Ullal added. "Clearly, Crystal Solar had a unique process that really stood out. Compared to the traditional silicon technology that involves slicing, this eliminates several steps that have an impact on the cost of the final PV product."\u000a\u000aSolar wafers at 13 cents per watt\u000a\u000aThe new epitaxial system can produce up to 500 wafers per hour and sells for less than $5 million, while replacing traditional reactors and pullers. That translates to a wafer cost of about 13 cents per watt, less than half the typical cost of 30 cents per watt for high-end wafers, Ravi said. The entire module cost is projected to be less than 50 cents per watt -- a reduction that could help nudge the installed cost of the solar system to less than $1 per watt.\u000a\u000aCrystalline silicon commands 90% of the solar market, and despite the rapid success of thin films and other materials such as perovskite, will likely remain the leading technology in the near future.\u000a\u000aInterest in the solar cells is huge, Ravi said. Crystal Solar is in the pilot manufacturing stage, and "we're struggling to keep up with the people who want our wafers. We want to set up a factory in the United States somewhere."\u000a\u000aRavi said the process lends itself to automation, which means labor costs -- much cheaper in Asia -- won't be such a big factor. "We don't have to go to a low-labor country -- I'm very proud of that," he said. Even though the approach requires less manpower, it will mean numerous good-paying American jobs.\u000a\u000a"We believe this technology will probably thrive in the United States, that it will be cheaper to do it here than anywhere else in the world," Ravi said. If the process continues to make high-quality efficient solar cells when ramped up to full manufacturing scale, it's a testimonial to the partnership between Crystal Solar, the Energy Department, and NREL, Ravi said.\u000a\u000aApproach eliminates several steps, is less expensive\u000a\u000aThe approach is cheaper and faster because it eliminates several steps, Ullal said. The device is actually built as gaseous silicon is deposited on a solid silicon substrate. A dopant or impurity can create the junctions that force current flow much more easily than in traditional solar cell manufacturing, Ravi said.\u000a\u000aAnother advantage: The material doesn't have to be rotated as it does in the ingot-growth process, which means the wafer remains a true square -- and that makes for better and more efficient packaging of the PV module.\u000a\u000aThe approach also incorporates less oxygen in the silicon layer, which has been shown to eliminate oxygen-related defects. That's important because it gives the photons that hit the cells a tiny bit longer to form into the electron-hole pairs that are essential to establishing a carrying current for electricity, and makes it less likely that the electron and hole will recombine. The difference is tiny -- 1.3 milliseconds versus a bit less than 1 millisecond -- but crucial in the world of photons and electrons.\u000a\u000a"Most silicon wafers are made in Asia," Ullal said. "But this epitaxy process gets you there. And 30% of the overall cost of a solar module is the cost of the silicon wafer."\u000a\u000aTypically, for epitaxial growth, wafers are arranged horizontally as layers are added. Crystal Solar arranges them vertically, for a smaller footprint, and passes the gas through a narrower space for a much higher growth rate.\u000a\u000a"The key challenge was how to hold that wafer vertically and still get uniformity," Ravi said. "That took us two-and-a-half years of researching for just the right material, the right shape, and so forth. There are so many advantages of the epitaxial method that it seems like a no-brainer. But the reason no one has really done it before is that it is a very hard thing to do in practice."\u000a\u000aHis company is looking for a site with low-cost access to electricity and a well-trained technical workforce. "There's great demand for solar energy. We're talking about hundreds of gigawatts in the next couple of decades."\u000a\u000aNREL's collaboration with Crystal Solar is just one of dozens of working agreements with industry. "Partnerships with innovative private companies are part of the lifeblood of NREL," said Kristin Gray, director of NREL's Technology Transfer Office. Gray and colleague Anne Miller noted that NREL, year after year, has more cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with private companies than any other federal laboratory. For every dollar that the Energy Department invests in a CRADA, it attracts another $6 in total value from all industry contracts. During the past year, NREL signed 20 new license agreements and filed more than 60 new patent applications.\u000a\u000a"NREL scientists and engineers, working with companies with innovative ideas for sustainable energy, are accelerating the move toward a clean energy economy," Miller said.\u000a\u000aLearn more about NREL's photovoltaic research.\u000a\u000aSource: NREL

VLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam that produces enough power for 1.3 million people annually. It calls for construction of an expansive wind farm 40 miles north of Cheyenne and a massive energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aSuccess hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be completing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, which delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.

VATLANTA -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel.\u000a\u000aThey won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for having an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and the radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aBy law, the federal government is responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. After a lawsuit, the Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year.\u000a\u000aNo one is certain what comes next. Federal timelines would put off many big decisions about a permanent resting place for the waste until long after Obama leaves office.\u000a\u000aIndustry officials are praising even limited signs of forward movement, including federal interest in a train.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."

BLOOD and MEAD GRUVER, Associated Press\u000a\u000aLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The push for clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases has led to multibillion-dollar investments in wind and solar projects, but finding an economical way to store renewable energy that comes and goes like the breeze or the sun has proved challenging.\u000a\u000aAn alliance of four companies say they have found an answer in an underground salt formation.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the group proposed an $8 billion power project that would start with twirling turbines on a huge wind farm in Wyoming and end with enough electricity for over 1 million households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aKey links between the two would be an energy storage site inside Utah caverns carved out of the salt formation and a 525-mile electric transmission line cutting across several western states.\u000a\u000a"Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the holy grail of utilities and energy companies," said Travis Miller, an analyst for investment research giant Morningstar.\u000a\u000aConstruction is far from assured -- the proposal faces years of regulatory reviews, and success will also hinge on striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing to build it.\u000a\u000aJeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, called it "a landmark of the clean energy revolution."\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," he said in a statement, referring to the 726-foot-high span across the Colorado River that produces hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona and California.\u000a\u000aThe announcement came on the same day that President Barack Obama urged world leaders to follow the United States' lead on climate change in a U.N. summit aimed to gather support for a treaty to reduce heat-trapping pollution.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal, with a tentative completion date of 2023, would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam.\u000a\u000aBut with potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, 10 years, has a lot of uncertainties," said Miller, the analyst.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement that they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal before the Tuesday announcement. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable power required under state law.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be competing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, whose members deliver electricity to about 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by the Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.

VChatting with students Thursday at Academy 360 in Denver's Montbello neighborhood, Mayor Michael Hancock made a little confession: He shared in their wonderment regarding solar energy.\u000a\u000a"When I was your age, I used to see these magical solar panels on houses, and I wondered what they did," Hancock said. "They were very expensive to have then, and they still are. But because of this project, we'll all be able to share in affordable energy."\u000a\u000aColorado was the first state to give people the option of moving past the individual panels and receiving solar energy via shared electric systems. Now, a Colorado Springs-based company, SunShare, is partnering with Xcel Energy to bring the technology to Denver.\u000a\u000aSunShare is building community solar gardens in Adams, Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson counties to go along with two that have been online in Colorado Springs for the past two years.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Hancock, City Council president Chris Herndon and other officials were at the school to celebrate an agreement in which the families of each of the 125 charter school students will receive six-tenths of a kilowatt of free solar energy in their homes.\u000a\u000aAccording to SunShare CEO David Amster-Olszewski, that will mean about a 20 percent reduction in those families' monthly home energy bill.\u000a\u000a"That will have a big impact -- it means they'll be able to put healthier foods on the table or buy more sports equipment for their kids' health," he said.\u000a\u000a"Four years ago, this was illegal. ... That's why we're partnering with Academy 360 -- solar energy is the future, and these kids and this school ... are the future, too."\u000a\u000aColorado passed the Community Solar Act, allowing the solar/electrical partnerships, four years ago. Now, 16 other states have passed or are in the process of passing similar legislation. Denver's first solar garden, near Denver International Airport, is expected to go online early next year; when that happens, Amster-Olszewski said, he'll be spending a lot more time with the Academy 360 students.\u000a\u000a"We're going to bring all the students and their families out to it, and they'll be able to place their own panels on the grid," he said. "Today is really cool, but that will be the cherry on top."

VLOS ANGELES, Sept. 23, 2014 /Nassau News Live/ -- Four companies today jointly proposed a first-in-the-U.S., $8-billion green energy initiative that would bring large amounts of clean electricity to the Los Angeles area by 2023.\u000a\u000aThe project would require construction of one of America's largest wind farms in Wyoming, one of the world's biggest energy storage facilities in Utah, and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting the two sites.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam - a landmark of the clean energy revolution," said Jeff Meyer, managing partner of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the four companies involved in the initiative.\u000a\u000aThe proposed project would generate more than twice the amount of electricity produced by the giant 1930s-era hydroelectric dam in Nevada - 9.2 million megawatt-hours per year vs. 3.9 million megawatt-hours.\u000a\u000aA key component of the project - a massive underground energy storage facility - would yield 1,200 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power plant and enough to serve an estimated 1.2 million L.A.-area homes.\u000a\u000aThe four companies - Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission - will formally submit their proposal to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015 in response to the agency's request for proposals to supply the Los Angeles area with renewable energy and electricity storage.\u000a\u000aThe underground energy storage facility would help solve one of renewable energy's biggest challenges - its intermittency. Wind farms produce no electricity when there's no wind; solar farms produce no electricity when there's no sun.\u000a\u000aLinking the wind farm to the energy storage facility would enable the wind farm to function largely like a traditional coal, nuclear or natural gas power plant - capable of reliably delivering large amounts of electricity whenever needed, based on customer demand.\u000a\u000aThe energy storage facility also would reduce the need for L.A.-area utilities to build expensive backup power plants and power lines to serve customers on days when there's no wind, at night when there's no sunlight, and during other periods when traditional wind and solar farms are unable to produce electricity.\u000a\u000aKey components of proposed project\u000a\u000aVideo about project (5 minutes) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i1OXVto6_w\u000a\u000aMedia teleconference today - 1 p.m. Eastern Time (10 a.m. Pacific)\u000a\u000aUnited States and Canada: 888-206-4836\u000a\u000aInternational: 1-913-312-1504\u000a\u000aConference ID: "LA green energy"\u000a\u000aSpeakers:\u000a\u000aCompany profiles

VLast week, a 24-year-old jorts-wearing Russian tourist named Yaroslav Kolchin scaled the Brooklyn Bridge in broad daylight, took some photos with his iPhone, and was promptly taken into police custody. After missing his flight back to Moscow and spending a week behind bars, Kolchin appeared in a Brooklyn court on Friday to learn more about the legal consequences of his big American adventure.\u000a\u000aAccording to a prosecutor Lawrence Mottola, Kolchin's stunt cost the NYPD $7,407. (Extra officers, two boats, and a helicopter were all sent to the scene.) The New York Daily News reports that Mottola suggested that Kolchin plead guilty to trespassing, which carries a maximum sentence of 90 days, but the young thrill-seeker rejected the deal.\u000a\u000aJudge ShawnDya Simpson offered a more creative solution: "Maybe have [Kolchin] clean a bridge, I don't know. If he likes the bridge so much, let him clean a bridge," she said, explaining that she felt "a bunch of community service" would be the most appropriate punishment for Kolchin's relatively harmless actions. That sounds reasonable to us! Unfortunately, it probably won't happen. "Judges have latitude when sentencing defendants to community service. However, there are well-established community service programs that are used as the norm," a court spokesman told the New York Post. But, a "court source" added, it's "highly unlikely" that Kolchin will end up scrubbing down the Brooklyn Bridge, since there's no program in place for doing so. Meanwhile, the 24-year-old is now out on $5,000 bail, which means he's free to continue enjoying New York City's many landmarks as he sees fit.

VLOS ANGELES -- Four energy companies proposed an $8 billion project Tuesday that within a decade could send wind power generated on the plains of Wyoming to power-thirsty households in Southern California.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling venture -- if approved and financed -- would create one of the country's largest wind farms, a huge energy storage site and a 525-mile electric transmission line connecting them.\u000a\u000a"This project would be the 21st century's Hoover Dam," said Jeff Meyer of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the companies behind the plan, referring to the 726-foot high span across the Colorado River that for decades has produced hydroelectric power for Nevada, Arizona, and California.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal would potentially generate twice as much energy as the 1930s-era dam that produces enough power for 1.3 million people annually. It calls for construction of an expansive wind farm 40 miles north of Cheyenne and a massive energy storage site inside caverns in Utah.\u000a\u000aSuccess hinges on a string of uncertainties, including clearing government regulatory hurdles and striking agreements to sell the power that would be essential to secure financing.\u000a\u000a"This would certainly be one of the most ambitious and expensive energy infrastructure projects we have seen," said Travis Miller, an industry analyst for investment research giant Morningstar Inc. "Energy storage, paired with renewable energy, has been the Holy Grail of utilities and energy companies."\u000a\u000aWith potential shifts in government policy, environmental regulation and the economics of producing green power "any infrastructure project that looks out nine, ten years, has a lot of uncertainties," he said.\u000a\u000aPathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission Co. said in a statement they plan to submit the blueprint to the Southern California Public Power Authority by early 2015.\u000a\u000aCalifornia agency officials said they were unaware of the proposal. The authority has been seeking proposals to supply the Los Angeles region with renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThe new plan "would be completing with 200 other proposals," said Steven Homer, the director of project management for the authority, which delivers electricity to approximately 2 million customers.\u000a\u000aWind development in Wyoming's wide expanses has surged in the past decade as companies and state officials seek cleaner alternatives to coal.\u000a\u000aThe proposed wind power development near Chugwater would be a boon to the sleepy ranching town of 216 residents nestled below sandstone bluffs on the high prairie.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, in a desperate bid to revive their economically depressed community, town officials sold city lots for $100 apiece on the condition that the buyer would build a house and live there at least two years. Results were mixed, at best: Chugwater's population dropped 11 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as Wyoming's overall economy grew and population increased.\u000a\u000aIf completed, it would become Wyoming's second-largest wind power project. The biggest is a 1,000-turbine site planned by The Anschutz Corp. That project near Saratoga, in south-central Wyoming, is the largest under development in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe rapid growth in wind power has come with a cost, however. The U.S. government estimates at least 85 eagles are killed each year by wind turbines. An Associated Press investigation in 2013 revealed that the Obama administration was not prosecuting wind energy companies for killing eagles and other protected birds.\u000a\u000aA lynchpin in the plan would be a $1.5 billion energy storage site near Delta, Utah, 130 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. The rural area already is home to one coal-powered plant that generates electricity for Los Angeles County.\u000a\u000aWith the push for pollution-free energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, billions of dollars have been invested in wind and solar projects. Finding an economical way to store renewable energy, however, has been a key issue.\u000a\u000aUnder the proposal, the energy would be stored through a compressed-air system using caverns, similar to a system that has been used in Alabama since the early 1990s. When energy demand is low, excess electricity would be used to compress and inject high-pressure air into the four caverns, each of which would have 41 million cubic feet of volume. At times of high energy demand, the high-pressure air would be combined with a small amount of natural gas to power eight electricity-producing generators.

VThe federal government is in search of trains for hauling radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites - even though the waste locations haven't actually been found yet.\u000a\u000aCompanies were recently asked by the United States Department of Energy for ideas on how the government should acquire rail cars for transporting150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel, according to a report by the Associated Press.\u000a\u000aYet, the government's latest plans are for establishing an interim test storage site by 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration apparently has no idea where those waste facilities will be sited, but is nonetheless anticipating contracts to develop, test and certify the rail equipment needed for the hazardous hauls.\u000a\u000aEnergy Department officials - who recently asked for public feedback on whether they should should buy or lease the rail cars - did not return messages from the AP seeking detailed comment for the story.\u000a\u000aPrevious communications from the department demonstrate it expects the sought rail cars to last up to 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks necessary as nuclear shielding and run up to eight times each year.\u000a\u000aThe military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage and the civilian power industry shipping more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers of nuclear waste has been Progress Energy, moving spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant in North Carolina.\u000a\u000aThe rail shipments sparked protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000aTracks for the nuclear waste trains were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel.\u000a\u000aBut, the Obama administration canceled the depository construction project after it had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government is by law responsible for nuclear fuel disposal and once charged electric customers to fund its work. The Energy Department quit collecting that fee this year, after it was taken to court.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, nuclear industry observers are praising even the limited signs of forward movement from the government, even if it's only a matter of eyeballing trains.\u000a\u000a"This is a good timing," said Everett Redmond, who works on waste policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. "You don't want to wait until you're close to opening the facility to try and design a rail car."\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments of nuclear waste.

VDebbie Dooley is not a tree-hugger -- in fact she bills herself as a radical right-wing grandmother, and she is a founding member of the national Tea Party and a leader of the Atlanta Tea Party.\u000a\u000aBut Dooley is also an outspoken proponent of distributed solar generation and other forms of renewable distributed energy. As founder of the Green Tea Coalition, a conservation-minded wing of the Tea Party, she has made numerous media appearances on outlets across the political spectrum.\u000a\u000aDooley spoke with Midwest Energy News before a trip to speak at the Wisconsin Solar Energy Industries Association's Solar Social Speakers series.\u000a\u000aQ. How did you become interested in renewable energy?\u000a\u000aA. I've been a political activist off and on since 1976. I was one of the 22 national founders of the Tea Party movement. I'm very active with the Atlanta Tea party, I serve on the board of directors of Tea Party Patriots, which has not and is not taking a position on solar.\u000a\u000aI began to get interested in energy with a fight we were carrying on with Georgia Power. They're a monopoly here in Georgia. They were not acting in the best interest of ratepayers in regards to some of their policies. They were building two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, and the utility customers were paying for that in advance. There were massive cost overruns expected, and yet they were making a guaranteed profit on the cost of the two reactors and the cost overruns.\u000a\u000aI began to take a closer look at energy for that reason. I've always been a free-market conservative. I began to realize a monopoly is not a free market, a monopoly violates free-market principles. Solar is a way to give monopolies very much needed competition. It also provides consumer choice.\u000a\u000aI founded the Green Tea Coalition, and I recently founded in the past week Conservatives for Energy Freedom. That's what I'm advocating for -- energy freedom and energy independence.\u000a\u000aQ. Have you been working directly on the issue of third-party-owned solar installations?\u000a\u000aA. Yes, in Georgia we are trying to allow that. Georgia Power is giving us a fight on that. They want to control it. Solar empowers the consumer and the individual. These giant monopolies want to take away that consumer choice unless they can control it. They are looking at their profit margins, not the best interests of ratepayers.\u000a\u000aThis is about the freedom to choose and create your own electricity. I think [policies that inhibit third-party-owned solar] are a blatant attack by these giant monopolies who at every turn have to construct a power plant, and make a profit off the construction of the power plant.\u000a\u000a[If] they have to buy some power from out of state, they pay fair market value -- so why shouldn't they buy their power from within the state and create jobs for Wisconsinites or whatever state they are in? If we open up the market for solar, there would be little need for them to have to construct more power plants.\u000a\u000aThe third-party solar that we're talking about, it is really good for the consumer because that means you don't have to go out and construct a power plant, it makes the fuel cost simpler, the utility companies are compensated for the time that solar customers pull power from the grid.\u000a\u000aQ. Is it strange for you being so outspoken on this topic since solar and distributed generation advocates are usually seen as liberal or environmentalists?\u000a\u000aA. A lot of companies with fossil fuel interests try to spin it that way. It's totally ridiculous. If you can't discredit the message, you go after the messenger.\u000a\u000aThis is not a liberal issue, it has become a national security issue for our country. The grid can be attacked. Look at the Silicon Valley attack -- they opened fire on some of the substations with AK-47s, took them down, and they just vanished into the night. Our grid is so centralized, it's a national security issue.\u000a\u000aWhen I started doing research and seeing what We Energies is trying to do in Wisconsin, I was appalled. Here you have a giant utility to trying to protect their profit margin by taxing the sun and taxing manure. You can call it whatever you want to, it is a tax. I think that is totally ridiculous.\u000a\u000aQ. Do you think your support of solar has extra significance since you are a high-profile conservative activist?\u000a\u000aA. I do, I believe conservatives who believe in the free market would be receptive to the right message. If you go out and say we need solar because of climate change and you hate coal, that's the wrong message. If you go out and hold elected officials accountable for supporting these monopolies, that's something conservatives will respond to.\u000a\u000aQ. Do you have solar panels or would you like to get them?\u000a\u000aA. I went through a divorce two years ago so I'm renting a house, but you can bet when I purchase a home it will have solar panels. You would be really surprised about conservatives, how many are asking me about solar panels. It empowers the individual and it's good for the environment. To me conservation is conservative.\u000a\u000aQ. How do you feel about wind energy, since much wind is generated by these large companies?\u000a\u000aA. I would support wind energy as well, though wind does not empower the individual like solar does. You can put solar panels on your rooftop, as long as you have daylight and a battery you can power yourself. It's harder for the individual to do that with wind.\u000a\u000aI was at the gym yesterday, watching TV on the treadmill, looking at a report on the History Channel that talked about sugar cane in Hawaii that was used to generate electricity. Any way we can be energy independent, I'm all for it. An all-of-the-above approach.\u000a\u000aQ. Does Republican opposition to taking action on climate change complicate your mission with this message?\u000a\u000aA. It does. I don't believe in excessive regulation, like all these regulations we've seen with EPA the past few years. I would prefer to allow energy to compete in the free market on a level playing field and let the consumer decide what is best.\u000a\u000aI fully believe energies that hurt the environment should be taxed. I don't believe in a carbon tax, I believe in a cleanup fund like with the BP spill in Gulf.\u000a\u000aI've advocated from the beginning to cut out massive subsidies that all energy forms have received. Some of the same conservatives that point a finger at Solyndra, they failed to point out the massive subsidies coal and nuclear have been receiving since the 1930s. That smacks of hypocrisy. If you're going to complain about subsidies for wind or solar, why are we still subsidizing nuclear and coal? Subsidies are government's way of picking winners and losers.\u000a\u000aQ. How have such statements been received when you talk to Tea Party or conservative audiences?\u000a\u000aA. I talked at the Tea Party convention and said government should stop picking winners and losers. I got thunderous applause. People are really receptive to the right message when you lay the facts out.\u000a\u000aI've been attacked by Koch brothers-affiliated groups. [Some] said I was a fake Tea Party person. I just laughed. I am a conservative. There is no way they can paint me as a liberal, even as a moderate -- I am a right-wing conservative.\u000a\u000aBut I'm extremely passionate about alternative energy. I'm a grandmother, I became a grandmother in 2008 with the birth of a grandson who is the light of my life. I want him to have a clean world, I want him to have parks and green space. I don't want him to have to worry about terrorist attacks. I want him to be able to breathe clean air. I want him to be able to generate his own electricity if he so chooses.\u000a\u000aIf he says, "I want to generate my own power and be self-sufficient," I want him to have the ability to do it.

VAs we've mentioned before, New York is changing how it evaluates and compensates electric utilities. One goal of this change is increased consumer engagement, which makes customers allies in the development of a more reliable, resilient, and 'smart' electric grid.\u000a\u000aMany customers have begun taking advantage of new energy technologies and their falling prices by turning to community microgrids, installing on-site distributed generation, like rooftop solar, or investing in more efficient appliances, among other actions. Advances in telecommunications and information systems have also created new opportunities for energy services we could not have imagined just a few years ago. For example, innovative tools like demand response allow third parties or utilities to turn off pre-approved appliances - like swimming pool pumps and air conditioners - remotely when the power grid is stressed and needs a quick reduction in energy demand.\u000a\u000aTo this end, more customers are adopting local, distributed energy resources (distributed energy). These are customer-focused energy resources that either reduce energy demand - through energy efficiency measures or demand response programs - or generate electricity on-site. In order to support its goals of reforming the state's utility business model, New York will have to take into account the increased role of distributed energy and properly value its costs and benefits.\u000a\u000aDistributed Energy can offset investments in infrastructure\u000a\u000aUnderstanding the benefits from making such investments can help avoid large costs ultimately shouldered by all customers. Take, for example, a large building that consumes a massive amount of electricity and places stress on the grid. Installing proven energy efficiency measures such as better lighting and insulation and even purchasing a new air conditioning system would substantially reduce energy use and operating expenses. It could also have a positive impact on the system at large and compare favorably with the cost of adding another substation - which could run into the millions - to meet increased energy load demand in the neighborhood.\u000a\u000aTiming matters\u000a\u000aWhile energy efficiency helps utilities avoid extra costs by reducing total demand, many of the benefits coming from energy efficiency and other types of distributed energy vary over the course of the day. Reductions in energy demand through on-site power generation, energy storage, or demand response programs have a much larger benefit during peak times when utility infrastructure is pushed to the limit. Incentivizing households and businesses to either produce electricity during peak times or shift their energy use to times of day when there is less demand on the power grid can help utilities avoid investments such as installing new wires or other equipment or upgrading a substation. Furthermore, because these activities are more valuable to the system during peak times, they should be priced accordingly. Demand response at 4pm is a heck of a lot more valuable than it is at 4am when energy-intensive appliances aren't generally being used.\u000a\u000aLocation, location, location\u000a\u000aAlso, benefits vary depending on how much distributed energy is deployed in the area. For example, the utility's ability to avoid costly infrastructure upgrades is made possible only by reaching a critical mass of distributed energy resources; thus, the impact of an extra kilowatt (kW) of solar energy is much greater in an area with little distributed energy. Finally, the benefits can also vary depending on the energy demands in a particular location. Some areas may be ripe for rapidly-growing energy needs, which may require infrastructure upgrades. Incentivizing distributed energy in such an area would yield a larger benefit than in areas where there are no foreseen upgrade needs.\u000a\u000aAll benefits and costs need to be properly valued\u000a\u000aAs customers begin to use more distributed energy, utilities must fully value all of its benefits in order to make more optimal planning decisions. This includes benefits that may not yet have a known market price, such as carbon pollution. For instance, producing solar - in lieu of fossil fuel - electricity has important health and environmental (or "social") benefits in the form of reduced carbon emissions. The federal government has priced the social cost of carbon at approximately $40 per ton and has other methods for valuing all the benefits of reduced pollution that utilities could adopt. If pollution emissions are not properly valued by the utility, the full benefits of switching to clean electricity sources or customers reducing their demand will be left unaccounted for in the utility's decision-making process.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, adding distributed energy to a utility's mix may incur some costs that should also be included in the valuation process. Increased reliance on distributed energy requires investment in new equipment, such as modernized electricity meters that could help incentivize demand response among customers in areas and at times that need it most. Properly valuing costs, along with the array of benefits, can help utilities better understand whether or not these new investments in distributed energy resources pass the cost-benefit test.\u000a\u000aThis is an exciting and important time to be working in the electricity sector. After a 100-year reign, the "make more, sell more, profit more" utility business model is being reconsidered, and there is real potential for smarter, cleaner solutions. But we need to make sure that utilities are considering (and valuing) all of the features that will transform our outmoded energy system into a truly intelligent, efficient, connected network.\u000a\u000aLast month, EDF filed comments (Track 1 and Track 2) in New York State's historic 'Reforming the Energy Vision' (REV) proceeding to re-evaluate the longstanding utility business model in light of a rapidly changing energy sector. We recommend: 1) transitioning from traditional rate of return regulation to performance-based regulation; 2) fully valuing all costs and benefits associated with distributed energy resources; 3) removing barriers to non-utility entities participating in energy service markets; and 4) requiring the utility to optimize the load it serves.

VMissile Defense Agency officials overpaid for a contract by millions of dollars because they ignored the findings of the Pentagon office charged with overseeing such negotiations.\u000a\u000aA *report from the Department of Defense's inspector general found MDA officials submitted a request to the Defense Contract Audit Agency for a $2 billion anti-warhead project.\u000a\u000aWhile the DCAA looked over the proposal to ensure the costs were kept as low as possible, MDA officials forged ahead with contract negotiations and slashed the scope of the project by half without notifying their auditors.\u000a\u000aThe inspector general said the missile agency entered into the eventual $1 billion contract before the final DCAA audit was complete, ignoring preliminary findings that would have saved the Pentagon millions.\u000a\u000aAmong other missteps, the MDA paid out $73 million to the contractor it should have withheld due to government rules that dictate how to compensate companies for work performed before a contract is reached.\u000a\u000aThe provision, known as a "letter contract," is meant to protect the government's interests in cases where a project must begin immediately and prevents agencies from paying contractors more than 85 percent before an agreement is finalized.\u000a\u000aHowever, the missile agency paid the defense contractor in full before signing the contract.\u000a\u000aThe audit agency had concerns about $224 million of the costs included in the original contract before ending its audit because missile agency officials had already signed with the contractor.\u000a\u000aGo here to read the full report.

VHEADLINE2Wisconsin Families & Farmers Benefit From Support\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food (CFSAF) today applauded Representative Tom Petri (R-WI-06) for cosponsoring the bipartisan Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which will establish national labeling standards for food and beverage products and eliminate the potential confusion and bureaucratic, costly red tape stemming from a 50-state patchwork of laws and regulations that could raise the could cost of food.\u000a\u000a"In sponsoring The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, Representative Petri is taking an important stand on behalf of consumers, food safety and science," said Claire Parker, spokeswoman for the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food. "American families deserve access to safe and affordable food, and this legislation will ensure that important food safety and labeling decisions are made by scientists, not political activists."\u000a\u000aThe Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act would prevent duplicative labeling, increased transportation costs, unnecessary product warehousing, burdensome product segregation plans and highly inefficient transportation requirements. A state-by-state patchwork of labeling laws would not advance food safety, inform consumers, or provide consistency in labeling.\u000a\u000a(According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 95 percent of Wisconsin's soybean farmers and 92 percent of its corn farmers rely on GMO technology to consistently and economically grow their crops, using fewer pesticides, less water and more efficient use of their land. That translates into affordable food for consumers on the supermarket shelves.)\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the legislation reaffirms the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as America's sole authority on food safety and labeling requirements; requires the FDA to approve all new GMO ingredients before they are brought to market; sets a federal standard for the labeling definition of "natural;" and establishes federal standards for companies that wish to voluntarily label their products for the absence-of or presence-of GMO food ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe most influential food safety regulatory agencies and organizations around the world, including the FDA, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that GMOs are as safe as any other foods. In addition, studies have shown that unnecessary GMO labeling would increase costs for the average family by approximately $400 per year.\u000a\u000aThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is a broad-based coalition representing the entire American agriculture food chain - from farm to fork. CFSAF is committed to increasing understanding about the science and safety of GM technology and to advocating for a federal labeling solution.

VImage: Sara D'Eugenio Chris Lewicki wants you to help him find platinum-rich asteroids to mine.\u000a\u000aChris Lewicki knows how to harness resources. As a space-crazed eighth-grader in chilly northern Wisconsin, Lewicki couldn't read enough about the 1989 flight of the Voyager 2 past Neptune. So he started a space club at his school to score an educational discount on NASA data.\u000a\u000aToday Lewicki is president and chief engineer of Planetary Resources, a company devoted to mining asteroids. (Yes, really.) The Redmond startup was founded in 2010 by Eric Anderson and Peter Diamandis, who between them cofounded the X Prize and space tourism company Space Adventures. The goal is to extract water, platinum, and more from the rocks that hurtle through our solar system, a process that starts with the most abundant resource here on Earth: bored people on the Internet.\u000a\u000aIn June, Planetary Resources launched Asteroid Zoo (asteroidzoo.org), a simple web app that allows anyone to search for space rocks. Using a technique that predates computers, viewers see four consecutive night-sky images in the world's shortest flip book. Then they tag tiny movements from small blurry smudges -- which are, presumably, asteroids.\u000a\u000aMore than a million photos were surveyed by amateur astronomers in the first two weeks after the app went live, each entry honing Planetary Resources' recognition programs. "Even an eight-year-old human brain can find these little patterns better than your average computer can," says Lewicki. (For now; he figures "humans can help train the machines, and the machines will eventually overthrow us." You've been warned.)\u000a\u000aWhy the search? Because there's gold in them there space rocks, or rather more platinum than has ever been mined on Earth. Plus, did you know there's water on asteroids? And in space terms, its value extends well past thirst quenching: The hydrogen and oxygen found in the water on a single asteroid the size of a football field could have fueled all of NASA's 135 shuttle launches.\u000a\u000aThis fall Planetary Resources will launch its first craft to scout minefields. It's a brave new legal world of resource extraction. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prevents earthlings from claiming space as sovereign territory, but thanks to its vague verbiage on mining, Lewicki estimates his company will be extracting asteroid booty by 2021.\u000a\u000aEven as they finesse complex tech, Lewicki's bringing amateurs into the fold. A $1.5 million Kickstarter campaign will fund a telescope the company will attach to its second spacecraft, due to launch next year. The 17,614 backers can control its viewfinder and project a photograph to take a "space selfie."\u000a\u000aLewicki himself was the flight director of two of NASA's Mars rovers, but over time he saw the agency grow increasingly risk averse. "When failure is not an option, success gets really expensive," he says. He wants to be like NASA in the 1960s, when it was willing to "throw nine things at the moon and keep going until something worked."\u000a\u000aPlanetary Resources is backed by enough deep pockets -- including those of Larry Page of Google, Charles Simonyi of Microsoft, and Ross Perot Jr. of Texas -- that Lewicki can afford to fail and keep trying. This fall's probe, launched to and then from the International Space Station is "probably not going to be perfect," he says, but the launches will continue until one succeeds. Until then, he'll turn us all into his personal space club.

VHalfway through his six-month Blue Dot mission, ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst is sharing the International Space Station with only two colleagues: Maxim Suraev and Reid Wiseman.\u000a\u000aThe astronauts from Expedition 40 left the orbital outpost last week and landed safely back on Earth. Max, Alexander and Reid will have the Space Station to themselves until the next Soyuz spacecraft arrives on 25 October with NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore and cosmonauts Elena Serova and Alexander Samoukutyaev.\u000a\u000aBut the research work does not come to a halt during the two weeks the Station has a reduced crew.\u000a\u000aOn 22 September Alexander and Reid will use the robotic arm to grapple and berth the latest Dragon cargo vessel bringing supplies. They began preparing the workstation by routing cables and setting up controls in the six-window Cupola observatory. Alexander also collected items for return to Earth on the Dragon ferry.\u000a\u000aInternational science\u000a\u000aAlexander and Reid continue to collect inputs for ESA's Energy experiment that charts precisely how many calories astronauts need in space. The duo took urine and water samples and prepared them for for analysis on Earth.\u000a\u000aFor Japan's space agency, JAXA, Alexander worked on experiments on growing semiconductors in microgravity and how animal cells sense gravity.\u000a\u000aAlexander continues to use his experience as a volunteer firefighter for NASA's experiments burning fuel droplets. The results will improve our understanding of how fires behave in space and help to raise the fuel efficiency of engines on the ground.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Alexander worked on MagVector, a European experiment investigating how Earth's magnetic field interacts with electrical conductors. This research will not only help to improve future Space Station experiments and electrical experiments but it could also offer insights into how magnetic fields influence conductors in general - a backbone of terrestrial technology.\u000a\u000aIn his spare time, Alexander takes amazing images of our planet and continues to work on scientific experiments. The large Electromagnetic Levitator arrived at the Station on ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle in August but a bolt securing the hardware for launch was stuck. Alexander managed to saw the bolt out, cleverly using shaving foam to keep any metal debris from floating free. All in a day's work for an astronaut.

VA 22-acre brownfield site in South Toledo, Ohio (US), once in receivership, is starting a new life as home to a field solar array that will supply about 30% of the Toledo Zoo's electricity each year.\u000a\u000aBordered by a buffer zone with newly planted trees and green spaces for native grasses that will be planted this fall, the 28,500-panel solar array is one of the largest in the nation to supply power to a zoo.\u000a\u000aGEM Energy celebrated the commissioning of the array in July with business and local government leaders.\u000a\u000aThe array and property are owned by a group of investors as part of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) structured by GEM Energy, which also designed, developed and constructed the solar array. The ground-mount system contains no moving parts, and is expected to produce approximately 2.1MW per year. This is equivalent to the electricity use of 308 homes and has offsets the greenhouse gas emissions of 472 passenger vehicles.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, the company also designed and built the Toledo Zoo's Solar Walk. The Solar Walk includes more than 1,400 solar panels and is designed to resemble a snake winding along the perimeter of the zoo parking lot to the entrance. Last year, the Solar Walk generated 99,041.29 kWh of electricity equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of nine and half homes or 159 barrels of oil.\u000a\u000aThe Toledo Zoo is committed to inspiring others to join in caring for animals and conserving the natural world.

VIn fighting wildland or structural fires, it's hard to overstate the value of water to firefighters. The drought, of course, is making water more precious than ever, but firefighters say they fight fires in 2014 as they were trained to: using only as much water as necessary.\u000a\u000aFirefighters have felt the drought's effect when they're not fighting fires. Training exercises are now using less water, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Woodside and Menlo Park fire protection districts. Water use is also down at fire stations.\u000a\u000aAt Station 8 at 135 Portola Road in Portola Valley, the Woodside fire district recently replaced its grass front lawn with mostly native drought-tolerant and fire-resistant plants. The project budget ranged from $20,000 to $35,000, Battalion Chief Jerry Nave told the Almanac.\u000a\u000aHad they considered artificial grass? "The reason we did not pursue artificial turf was because of the discussion/disagreement that transpired with the turf proposition at Woodside Priory (in Portola Valley)," Fire Chief Dan Ghiorso said in an email. "I/we felt it was not worth even looking at that option. Staff all agreed that we needed to reduce our water consumption, and at the same time keep the 'look' of the neighborhood we share."\u000a\u000aChief Ghiorso was referring to a contentious 2013 plan to install artificial grass at the soccer field of the Priory, a private Catholic boarding school for grades 6-12. The Planning Commission OK'd the idea by a 3-2 vote, but it was overturned by the Town Council, also on a 3-2 vote. With strong environmental arguments to be made for and against artificial grass, and in a town known for its green ethic, passions were high.\u000a\u000aDrought-tolerant fire-resistant landscaping will also replace the lawn at district's Woodside headquarters at 3195 Woodside Road, where irrigation has ended, Mr. Nave said.\u000a\u000aThe Woodside district, which serves Portola Valley, Woodside and neighboring unincorporated communities, has cut way back on training exercises that use water, Mr. Nave said. If training does involve water, it's done with recycled water or in an area that needs a good soaking. Water suppliers, including the California Water Service Company, have told the district not to open fire hydrants for training, he said.\u000a\u000aThe headquarters has long had a fire-safe garden planted with drought-tolerant and fire-resistant native plants suitable for home landscaping. It's there to show residents what's possible, Mr. Nave said. The garden was replanted recently, and a smaller fire-safe garden will be going in at the Portola Valley station, he said.\u000a\u000aIn the Menlo Park fire district, the lawns at five fire stations are green but plastic. Replacing the grass with drought-tolerant plants was considered, but visits by children who like to play on the grass, sometimes with pets, and the need to lay out equipment for cleaning led to the decision to use plastic, Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman and Battalion Chief Frank Fraone said.\u000a\u000aArtificial lawns "make the stations look nice," Mr. Fraone said. The district serves Menlo Park, East Palo Alto, Atherton and the nearby unincorporated communities. "We have lots of kids at the stations all the time," he added. "We're very pleased with the (new lawns)."\u000a\u000aAt the main station on Middlefield Road, the plastic grass will be bordered by drought-tolerant plants and crushed rock, Mr. Fraone said. Some previous vegetation, including hydrangeas, has been pulled out and irrigation is limited to survival needs.\u000a\u000aAs in the Woodside district, Menlo Park has reduced training that relies on water. Exercises that do use water use less of it, Mr. Fraone said. Many exercises are held using a tank system that captures the runoff and recycles it.\u000a\u000aIn a July report to the board, Chief Schapelhouman recapped water conservation measures. Sightings of spanking clean fire engines and staff vehicles will be fewer. No more washing of personal vehicles or concrete at fire stations, and no more fire hydrant flushing.\u000a\u000aHydrant checks must be done with water conservation in mind. The same is true for personal showers, laundry and dish washing. Water use is monitored by station.\u000a\u000aMany steps taken locally are also in effect at Cal Fire stations around the state, said Scott McLean, a battalion chief for the Northern California branch of Cal Fire. Real grass is out, drought-tolerant vegetation is in, equipment cleaning is less frequent, and personal water use at stations is down.\u000a\u000aAt one Cal Fire station, firefighters reduced the flow from a storage tank to the point at which bacteria that prefer still water found conditions in the tank favorable, Mr. McLean said.\u000a\u000aDuring training, firefighting aircraft drawing water from a pond return it to the pond when dumping it.\u000a\u000aDuring wildland firefighting, all water use is monitored and logged, regardless of its source, Mr. McLean said. Nozzle sizes are smaller. In mopping up operations, the emphasis is on digging up soil and adding "a little water" as necessary, he said.

VATLANTA -- The U.S. government is looking for trains to haul radioactive waste from nuclear power plants to disposal sites. Too bad those trains have nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aPutting the cart before the horse, the U.S. Department of Energy recently asked companies for ideas on how the government should get the rail cars needed to haul 150-ton casks filled with used, radioactive nuclear fuel. They won't be moving anytime soon. The latest government plans call for an interim test storage site in 2021 and a long-term geologic depository in 2048.\u000a\u000aNo one knows where those sites will be, but the Obama administration is already thinking about contracts to develop, test and certify the necessary rail equipment.\u000a\u000aU.S. Energy Department officials did not return messages seeking detailed comment. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation share responsibility for regulating shipments.\u000a\u000a"We know we're going to have to do it, so you might as well do it," said James Conca, senior scientist at the geoscience and environmental consulting firm UFA Ventures Inc. He has monitored a nuclear waste disposal site, helped design another and worked on cleanup efforts.\u000a\u000aIn a public solicitation, the Energy Department asked for opinions on whether it should buy or lease the rail cars. It expects the cars could last 30 years, run at standard speeds on regular tracks, accommodate the heavy protective casks and be used up to eight times annually. Besides a car to carry the cask, the trains would have buffer cars to maintain a safe distance between the crew and radioactive cargo.\u000a\u000aThe military already sends fuel by rail from its reactors on Navy ships to federal labs for storage. The civilian power industry hauled more than 2,300 tons by rail from 1979 to 2007, averaging just over nine trips annually, according to NRC data.\u000a\u000aNuclear fuel is extremely hot and radioactive when it is removed from a reactor. Utilities first cool spent fuel in a water-filled pool, then can transfer it to massive casks that sit on land. Neither option is supposed to be final.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest rail shippers was Progress Energy, which moved spent fuel from two of its plants to a third plant, Shearon Harris in North Carolina, because it had spare room in its spent fuel pool. The rail shipments prompted protests and appeals from environmental groups and local governments, and the company announced in 2003 it would halt those shipments after building land-based storage facilities at its other plants, eliminating the need for the transfers.\u000a\u000a"Their story to us was that it was basically they were tired of fighting," said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, which opposed the transfers on safety grounds.\u000a\u000aThe tracks were supposed to lead to a depository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where Congress intended to send radioactive fuel. Instead, the Obama administration cancelled a project that had been criticized as inadequate and opposed by many Nevadans.

For example, the Dragon capsule includes the first 3-D printer and 20 mice that are part of a new research program on the ISS. As well, scientists have packed an instrument into the Dragon that should improve hurricane forecasts on Earth.\u000a\u000aThis resupply mission is now the fourth of 12 planned by SpaceX, a space transport services company founded by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, NASA awarded the company a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) contract in order to design and realize a launch system for resupplying the ISS. Currently, the company is under a $1.6 billion NASA contract and last week, SpaceX won a $2.6 billion contract from NASA that would also include launching astronauts to the International Space Station by 2017.\u000a\u000aThe next launch of cargo bound to the ISS is currently planned for sometime in December. In the meantime, SpaceX may have an additional launch this year in order to test technology that will be important for flights with human crew members.

VThe final rules are due in 2015, and the FDA has been haggling over how to write them since Congress passed a food safety law in 2010. Regulators say balancing the need for tighter food safety standards after major food-borne illness outbreaks in spinach, eggs, peanuts and cantaloupe against the needs of farmers who are new to such regulations has been a challenge.\u000a\u000aMichael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says the agency is trying to "achieve the goal of food safety in a practical way." The rules are new terrain for the agency, he says.\u000a\u000aThe rules originally proposed in January 2013 would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination, making sure workers' hands are washed, irrigation water is clean and that animals stay out of fields, among other things. Food manufacturers would also have to submit food safety plans to the government to show they are keeping their operations clean. Those changes would in many cases require new equipment, paperwork and record-keeping.\u000a\u000aNone of those priorities would change in the revised rule. But after complaints from farmers big and small who said the rules were too burdensome, the new proposal would relax some standards for the amount of bacteria that can be found in irrigation water and reduce the frequency with which it is tested, in some cases. The proposal also reduces the amount of time required between fertilizing crops with raw manure and harvest and allows farmers to hold produce in a packing house without further regulations. The smallest farms would continue to be exempted from many of the rules.\u000a\u000aThe organic industry had expressed concerns about the rules, especially because many organic farmers use raw manure as fertilizer and try to treat irrigation water with fewer chemicals.\u000a\u000a"This approach has less potential to impose economic hardship on organic farmers, while at the same time supporting the safest food supply in the world," said Gwendolyn Wyard of the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aThe revised rules will also benefit brewers who sell leftover grain from making beer to ranchers and dairy farmers as animal feed. Brewers were concerned that they would have to comply with new rules for animal food -- including testing, audits and other safety measures. Friday's revisions clarified the brewers will not have to follow the animal food rules because they already follow rules for human food.\u000a\u000aThe Food safety law marks the first time the FDA would have real authority to regulate food on farms. The agency said when it proposed the rules that they could cost large farms $30,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe law was passed by Congress at the end of 2010, weeks before Republicans assumed control of the House. Since then, many GOP lawmakers have said the rules are too burdensome for farmers. Some Democrats advocating for organic farmers have also been critical.\u000a\u000aSupporters have said the new laws are needed after several high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks. While many farmers and food manufacturers already follow good food safety practices, the law would aim to ensure that all of them do. Government inspectors have pointed to dirty equipment, unsanitary conditions and animal feces as likely causes for salmonella, E. coli and listeria poisonings that have sickened hundreds in recent years. There are an estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodborne illness.\u000a\u000aThe rules governing produce are already somewhat tailored to make the changes easier on farmers. They would apply only to certain fruits and vegetables that pose the greatest risk, like berries, melons, leafy greens and other foods that are usually eaten raw. A farm that produces green beans that will be cooked and canned, for example, would not be regulated.\u000a\u000aIn addition to regulating farms and food manufacturing facilities, the food safety law authorized more inspections by the FDA and gave the agency additional powers to shut down facilities. The law also required stricter standards on imported foods.\u000a\u000aThe new proposal will have a 75-day comment period. The FDA is legally required to finalize the rules by next year after being sued by an advocacy group last year for missing deadlines.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

VIndustrial-scale solar, wind and geothermal projects could be built within a few miles of national parks in the California desert as part of the Obama and Brown administrations' efforts to combat climate change, under a mammoth plan released by federal and state officials Tuesday.\u000a\u000aConstruction of the plants, many of which could cover several square miles, would drastically alter desert vistas near national parks and wilderness areas, according to a draft of the Renewable Energy Conservation Plan, a joint state and federal project more than five years in the making.\u000a\u000aBut that would be offset by the climate-change benefits of allowing large solar and wind energy plants on more than 2million acres of the Mojave Desert, the report said.\u000a\u000aThe 8,000-page plan covers 22.5million acres of public and private land in the California desert, and was unveiled in Palm Springs by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif, and top state land management, energy and wildlife officials.\u000a\u000aPotential new solar and wind projects would "impose dramatic visual changes to high-value recreational areas," the plan acknowledges. More than 40 percent of the development areas are within 5 miles of legally protected areas, including Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and the Mojave National Preserve.\u000a\u000aBoxer's backing\u000a\u000a"I treasure the desert," said Boxer, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and an ardent advocate of action against climate change. "We're going to go where we have to go to get the energy, and we're not going to go where we can't go because we have to protect this God-given environment."\u000a\u000a"What we now have is a road map," said Jewell, who said the plan would allow renewable-energy plants in the areas of "least conflict" and preserve "areas that should never be developed."\u000a\u000aCalifornia Natural Resources Secretary John Laird indicated that Gov. Jerry Brown supported the plan.\u000a\u000aNational environmental groups have generally supported large-scale renewable energy development in the desert. But as plants have come online and more near approval, local communities and activist groups have moved sharply in opposition, arguing that the state and federal governments should put more focus on smaller-scale projects and put utility-scale solar plants on degraded farmland in the Central Valley and Imperial County.\u000a\u000aBarbara Boyle, a senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club, called the plan promising. She said there would be continued debate about where to build large plants.\u000a\u000aProtecting bighorn\u000a\u000aThe desert plan would set aside 4million acres of conservation areas to protect habitat and migration corridors. It would increase protection for 37 threatened or endangered species such as the desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep, as well as 31 types of desert ecosystems.\u000a\u000aIt would create a 5-mile buffer for three historic and protected trails: the Pacific Crest Trail, a hiking route that runs from the Mexican border to Canada; the Old Spanish Trail, a historic trade route that connected Santa Fe, N.M., with Los Angeles; and the Juan Bautista de Anza Trail, marking the path of the 1775 Spanish expedition that ended with the establishment of the future city of San Francisco.\u000a\u000aThe plan attempts to meet President Obama's goal of generating 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands, along with California's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by mid-century.\u000a\u000aFixing mistakes\u000a\u000aWhile emphasizing that large-scale renewable energy plants are "a top priority" for the Obama and Brown administrations, the plan attempts to correct mistakes made during the pell-mell "solar land rush" during Obama's first year in office, when billions of dollars in federal stimulus money helped build solar and wind projects on untouched desert land.\u000a\u000aThe most prominent example is the 5.4-square-mile Ivanpah solar plant built by BrightSource Energy of Oakland off Interstate 15 north of the Mojave National Preserve. Many more desert tortoises were discovered on the site than was anticipated, and problems have emerged with birds being incinerated when they fly in the path of the concentrated solar radiation.\u000a\u000aDavid Lamfrom, California desert program manager for the National Parks and Conservation Association, said the plan could be an improvement over the current system of scatter-shot development. But he said officials appear to have left in limbo several controversial proposals, including a 23-square-mile wind and solar plant in the Silurian Valley just south of Death Valley and a 3,000-acre solar plant at Soda Mountain, atop a bighorn sheep corridor near the Mojave National Preserve.\u000a\u000aKevin Emmerich, a former Death Valley park ranger who founded the watchdog site Basin and Range Watch, said officials are "calling this a conservation plan while they are planning on fragmenting up the large remaining sections of the California desert into 'development zones' and 'conservation zones,' which ultimately translates to a net loss of desert habitat."\u000a\u000aRooftop solar\u000a\u000aEmmerich said planners have refused to consider rooftop solar and other smaller-scale projects that "would actually produce energy at the point of use without transmission loss and save habitat."\u000a\u000aBut Mark Tholke, a vice president at EDF Renewables, an energy company that has built plants in the desert, said rooftop solar is inadequate to address climate change.\u000a\u000a"Many of us feel a real."

VFounded by Mike S. Robinson, Zero Down Solar has collaborated with Clean Power Finance to promote 'solar' installations and a better customer experience. This partnership allows Zero Down Solar to offer lower fixed rate prices in 12 states cutting electric bills in half in states like Hawaii where the power price is 35 cents per kilowatt hour.\u000a\u000aLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) September 12, 2014\u000a\u000aMike S. Robinson acting president and CEO of Zero Down Solar is pleased to announce that his company recently joined forces with Clean Power Finance as a direct partner. This partnership will allow more homeowners nationwide to go solar with "No loan, no deposit and no installation fee." The goal of Mike S. Robinson involves putting an end to the painful rising costs of energy nationwide. He states, "We are able to reach out to homeowners that would like to go solar but have had financial barriers to doing so....there's an untapped market of people struggling to pay for the rising costs of living, that's our target market!"The future for solar is bright. Less than one percent of homeowners nationwide have panels on their roof, but a growing number of people are ready to go green and save. Solar allows homeowners to put their energy costs in their own hands.\u000a\u000aThe companies' close collaboration will allow an even faster rate of adoption to helping homeowners go solar through the Clean Power Finance third party PPA financing plan. This will also allow Zero Down Solar to give their clients an improved "going solar" experience. This collaboration between the companies will result in installation times that are significantly faster. Other benefits of this partnership will include improved customer service. If an individual is looking to take the solar route, this partnership will stop him from encountering many unnecessary frustrations and inconveniences in making the big change.\u000a\u000aMost importantly, this partnership will be good for many clients' pocketbooks. People who are interested in the cheapest power prices in the state should pay close attention. The relationship between the two companies provides the best fixed rate prices available in the marketplace.\u000a\u000aPeople who are considering moving in the "solar" direction will definitely want to explore their options with Zero Down Solar as soon as possible. The priority at Zero Down Solar is to make the transition from fossil fuels to green energy as easy and painless as possible. The new partnership with Clean Power Finance only aims to enhance the overall customer experience. If you're highly passionate about having more disposable income to spend on yourself each month then it's time to stop paying the power company and time to go solar. Zero Down Solar is an easy solution. Stop giving the monopoly power company your hard earned dollar and choose to get power from the sun, after all, it free and it shines everyday!\u000a\u000aFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/09/prweb12164355.htm

VRICHMOND, Ind. -- A utility says its latest solar farm in eastern Indiana has started generating electricity.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal Power Agency says the eight-acre solar farm on the grounds of Richmond Power and Light contains about 4,000 solar panels. They will generate one megawatt of electricity at peak capacity, or enough electricity to power about 200 homes.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal says the Richmond solar farm utilizes a horizontal tracking system for the panels that enables them to move, tracking the sun throughout the day. It says construction began earlier this year and was completed this month. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Friday.\u000a\u000aIndiana Municipal also operates solar farms in Rensselaer (ren-suh-LEER') and Frankton. The not-for-profit wholesale power provider serves 59 Indiana communities.

VIn what developers called the Hoover Dam of its generation, four companies announced a $8 billion wind project outside Wheatland on Tuesday, which would deliver electricity generated in Wyoming to consumers in southern California.\u000a\u000aDevelopers said the project would solve one of the long-standing problems of renewable power generation -- the intermittent wind -- by storing electricity generated by the wind farm in a salt deposit in Utah.\u000a\u000a"It is dispatchable renewables, which is really the holy grail for renewable energy," said Jeff Meyer, managing partner of Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, one of the four companies behind the project.\u000a\u000aPower will be generated at a 2,100-megawatt-hour wind farm between Chugwater and Wheatland and sent over a 525-mile transmission line to Delta, Utah.\u000a\u000aElectricity there will be stored inside a cavern larger than the Empire State building hollowed out of a 5-mile long, 2-mile deep salt deposit. The developers said they would use compressed air storage, where air released from a capsule turns a turbine, to deliver power on demand.\u000a\u000aThe deposit is adjacent an existing power line running to the Los Angeles-area.\u000a\u000aTypically the challenge facing renewable power is delivering electricity when it is needed. Wyoming wind, for instance, often blows at night while power is needed in California during the morning hours.\u000a\u000aBut the storage facility solves that conundrum, the developers said. Wind power generated in Wyoming can be stored at the Utah facility overnight, which can then yield 1,200 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 1.2 million California homes, when needed.\u000a\u000a"The technology has existed since the 1970s," Meyer said. "It is the matter of finding the right geologic formation. Not every salt dome is dense enough, big enough or hard enough. And not every salt dome is located 100 yards from the transmission line you need to connect into."\u000a\u000aWork on the project is not expected to begin for another five years. The announcement made Tuesday comes in advance of a 2015 deadline from the Southern California Public Power Authority to submit plans for renewable energy and electricity storage.\u000a\u000aThe four companies behind the project are Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy, Magnum Energy, Dresser-Rand and Duke-American Transmission.

VSponsored by\u000a\u000aEnergy Northwest won a $23.5 million settlement from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the construction and licensing of a used nuclear fuel storage area at the Columbia Generating Station in Washington.\u000a\u000aThe final settlement adds $4.3 million to the previous $19.3 million provided by a March court ruling. The court ruling in March came nearly eight years after a court ruled that DOE was in breach of a contract for failing to accept spent nuclear fuel from the Columbia power plant. The settlement also provides for an annual claims process with DOE, which allows EN to recover damages through 2016 without having to pay costs for litigation.\u000a\u000aDOE has been legally obligated since 1998 to have a national repository operating and receiving fuel transfers from the nation's 104 nuclear units. EN began construction on the storage area in 2001, but when the DOE said there would not be a repository built in the U.S., EN filed an initial lawsuit in January 2004 seeking $56.9 million in damages.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, the court ruled that DOE was in breach of contract. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded EN full damages in February 2010, and the DOE appealed a portion of the claim.\u000a\u000aIn April 2011, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that EN was rightfully granted $2.9 million in overhead costs, but the federal government was not required to pay $6 million in interest charges.\u000a\u000aThe Appeals Court remanded the issue on payment for plant modifications for further hearing, but EN decided to forego further trial on the plant modifications claim in order to expedite payment of the judgment. That following July, a federal court awarded EN more than $48.7 million in damages for the construction and licensing of a used fuel storage area.\u000a\u000aEN filed a second action the same month seeking to recover a total of $24.9 million for the government's continued failure to accept the utility's spent fuel for a time period between September 1, 2006 and June 30, 2012.\u000a\u000aDOE stopped charging a fee meant to pay for the federal nuclear waste site in May.

VSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California and the federal government on Tuesday released an ambitious plan to combat climate change by accelerating the building of large renewable energy projects in the state?s sun-soaked desert while setting aside millions of acres for conservation.\u000a\u000aThe goal of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan is to identify areas ripe with renewable energy potential that would also have minimal impact on species such as the desert tortoise and a wide variety of avian life.\u000a\u000aThe plan is intended to spur development of up to 20,000 MW of power from solar, wind and other renewable energy sources over the next 25 years. That would more than double California?s current renewable energy production.\u000a\u000aIt would help the state meet its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by mid-century. The plan follows recent efforts approved by Governor Jerry Brown to encourage consumers to buy low-emission electric cars and to link its carbon cap-and-trade program with that of Quebec.\u000a\u000aThe plan would also create a reserve of protected lands covering more than 22 million acres of desert land in Southern California, most of it owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service, the U.S. Department of Defense and private landowners.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a press conference in Palm Springs on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said the draft plan strikes a balance between needed energy development and conservation.\u000a\u000a"So commonly we look across landscapes like this and think that there's nothing there. But there are a number of species that live just in this place," Jewell said.\u000a\u000a"We now have a roadmap that can be used in other areas across the country to say these are the areas with the greatest potential and the least conflict for development and these are the areas that should never be developed," she said.\u000a\u000aThe plan also has the potential to influence land use policies in other countries, said Laura Crane, director of the California Renewable Energy Initiative for the Nature Conservancy.\u000a\u000aA year and a half ago, her group hosted government officials from Mongolia on a tour of California?s Mojave Desert, and said they were interested in learning how to balance renewable energy development and protection of species, groundwater and ecosystem function.\u000a\u000aThe draft plan, five years in the making, has a long way to go before it is finalized, which is not expected until 2016. A 106-day public comment period on the draft kicks off on Friday. The plan will need to be approved by the BLM, the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Energy Commission before it can be implemented.\u000a\u000aCalifornia?s deserts are home to Native American tribes and people in desert communities, and also serve as important training locations for the U.S. military, all of which have their own perspectives on the blueprint.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Diane Craft and Steve Orlofsky)

VA proposed U.S. rocket engine similar to the iconic Apollo-era F-1 could replace the Russian technology found on many American military boosters, according to the firms behind its design.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, it could be compatible with both Pentagon and NASA rockets, so the same propulsion system that may someday send astronauts to Mars could also be used to launch military and spy satellites, they say.\u000a\u000aThe new engine, a liquid oxygen and kerosene-fueled system known as the AR-1, would be smaller than the F-1 that powered the Saturn V rocket, but have higher performance and provide some 500,000 pounds of thrust, according to Steve Cook, director of corporate development at Huntsville, Alabama-based Dynetics, which has partnered with Aerojet Rocketdyne to design the technology.\u000a\u000a"Imagine taking a big old F-1 and being able to put it in a much more compact unit and get much more performance out of it," he said in a telephone interview.\u000a\u000aUnder a contract for a program called Advanced Booster Engineering Demonstration and Risk Reduction, engineers at Dynetics in October 2012 began working on ways to lower risk -- and thus cost -- associated with building a future first-stage engine for the NASA's Space Launch System, the rocket designed to carry astronauts to the moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.\u000a\u000aThe SLS will use solid rocket engines left over from the space shuttle and may transition to LOX-kerosene systems. NASA in 2011 retired the shuttle and currently relies on Russia for rides to the International Space Station aboard Soyuz rockets at almost $70 million per seat.\u000a\u000aLast year, at NASA's request, Dynetics expanded the work to include modifying the design to also serve as a possible replacement to the Russian-made RD-180, used as a first-stage engine on the Atlas V in the Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program.\u000a\u000aRising tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the latter's invasion and subsequent annexation of the Ukraine's Crimea region earlier this year has drawn calls from some lawmakers and officials to end American reliance on Russia for access to space.\u000a\u000aWhile Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James has said deliveries of the RD-180 engine continue without interruption, she is also exploring ways to fund the development of a potential replacement -- and trying to open national-security launches to competition. The market is currently dominated by a Lockheed Martin Corp.-Boeing Co. joint venture called United Launch Alliance LLC, which makes the Atlas V and Delta IV family of boosters.\u000a\u000aIn the 1990s, with the shuttle making regular trips to the space station, domestic investment in LOX-hydrocarbon booster technology fell off dramatically, Cook said. "We basically outsourced it to the Russians," he said.\u000a\u000aIf the Air Force decides to move forward with a similar risk-reduction and technology development program as NASA, a prototype of the AR-1 could be ready in 2-1/2 years and "get to a full-up operational engine by 2019," Cook said.\u000a\u000aOther companies such as SpaceX, Orbital Sciences Corp., Blue Origin and, of course, the incumbent, ULA, will likely vie for any new government funding or program to develop a successor engine.

VWASHINGTON, Sept. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The public is invited to a free talk called "The Case of the Missing Martian Atmosphere" with Dr. Jared Espley in the Pickford Theater, third floor, Madison Building, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. on Thursday, September 18 at 11:30 a.m. EDT.\u000a\u000aJared Espley is a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and a team member on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. His talk will focus on climate change on Mars and the MAVEN mission.\u000a\u000aSeveral types of evidence from past Mars missions lead us to believe that Mars used to be much different from the dry, cold place we find today. Ancient gullies and canyons look as if they were carved by flowing water, minerals that can only be made in standing water have been found, and ancient volcanoes of many sizes litter the surface. Clearly, the atmosphere had to have been thicker and possibly warmer to support so much liquid water on the surface.\u000a\u000aWhat happened? Because Mars lacks a planetary-sized magnetic field, the solar wind is able to gradually erode its upper atmosphere. Could a whole atmosphere's worth of erosion have taken place? MAVEN which was launched on November 18, 2013 and is set to arrive September 21 should help us explore this possibility.\u000a\u000a"MAVEN's goals are related to one of the fundamental mysteries of Mars -- we want to figure out how Mars went from a warm, wet environment to the cold, dry desert we see today," Espley said.\u000a\u000aHe notes that the spacecraft won't actually touch down on the planet, but will dip into its atmosphere, enter an elliptical orbit, and sample the solar wind. It will examine how the atmosphere is thinning and why water disappeared over the area. Scientists hope that discovering more about how the climate on Mars shifted over long periods of time could offer greater understanding of our changing climate here on Earth.\u000a\u000aClimate Change on Mars is the first program of the 2014 fall science series of lectures sponsored by the Library's Science, Technology and Business division in partnership with NASA Goddard.\u000a\u000aIf you cannot make it to the lecture, it will be captured and later broadcast on the Library's science/technology webcast page and YouTube channel "Topics in Science" playlist in the coming months. In the meantime, you might be interested in viewing Dr. Pamela Conrad's 2013 program Extraterrestrial Real Estate- Measuring Habitability on Mars with the Curiosity Rover. You can view a recording of the program on the Library's Webcast page or YouTube channel. Also, NASA scientist Dr. James Garvin visited the Library in 2010 to give a Mars Update- you can view a webcast or YouTube video of his 2010 presentation.\u000a\u000aFor more information about NASA's MAVEN mission, visit:\u000a\u000awww.nasa.gov/maven\u000a\u000aLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO

VWater scarcity is not a problem just for the developing world. In California, legislators are currently proposing a $7.5 billion emergency water plan to their voters; and U.S. federal officials last year warned residents of Arizona and Nevada that they could face cuts in Colorado River water deliveries in 2016.\u000a\u000aIrrigation techniques, industrial and residential habits combined with climate change lie at the root of the problem. But despite what appears to be an insurmountable problem, according to researchers from McGill and Utrecht University it is possible to turn the situation around and significantly reduce water scarcity in just over 35 years.\u000a\u000aIn a new paper published in Nature Geoscience, the researchers outline strategies in six key areas that they believe can be combined in different ways in different parts of the world in order to effectively reduce water stress. (Water stress occurs in an area where more than 40 percent of the available water from rivers is unavailable because it is already being used - a situation that currently affects about a third of the global population, and may affect as many as half the people in the world by the end of the century if the current pattern of water use continues).\u000a\u000aThe researchers separate six key strategy areas for reducing water stress into "hard path" measures, involving building more reservoirs and increasing desalination efforts of sea water, and "soft path" measures that focus on reducing water demand rather than increasing water supply thanks to community-scale efforts and decision-making, combining efficient technology and environmental protection. The researchers believe that while there are some economic, cultural and social factors that may make certain of the "soft path" measures such as population control difficult, the "soft path" measures offer the more realistic path forward in terms of reducing water stress.\u000a\u000a(The details about each of the six key strategy areas are to be found below.)\u000a\u000a"There is no single silver bullet to deal with the problem around the world," says Prof. Tom Gleeson, of McGill's Department of Civil Engineering and one of the authors of the paper. "But, by looking at the problem on a global scale, we have calculated that if four of these strategies are applied at the same time we could actually stabilize the number of people in the world who are facing water stress rather than continue to allow their numbers to grow, which is what will happen if we continue with business as usual."\u000a\u000a"Significant reductions in water-stressed populations are possible by 2050," adds co-author Dr. Yoshihide Wada from the Department of Physical Geography at Utrecht University, "but a strong commitment and strategic efforts are required to make this happen."

VInventHelp, a leading inventor service company, is attempting to submit the Perfect Plastic to companies in the hopes of a good faith review.\u000a\u000aTwo inventors from Loves Park, Ill., know how vulnerable our payment cards are because of frequent usage. "I use my debit card daily, and the friction of sliding it out of my wallet and swiping it through slots causes my signature and the magnetic strip to wear away," said one inventor. In order to solve this problem, they conceived of a design.\u000a\u000aThe patent-pending PERFECT PLASTIC is an accessory that keeps the back of a credit, debit or gift card from becoming scratched and worn. It preserves the signature and magnetic swipe strip, which eliminates the need for replacement or manual typing of numbers. As a result, it saves time, effort and money. The accessory is easy to use and producible in design variations.\u000a\u000aThe original design was submitted to the Milwaukee office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers. For more information, write Dept. 13-MLM-510, InventHelp, 217 Ninth Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, or call (412) 288-1300 ext. 1368.

VThe Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will discuss the ongoing drought Tuesday and formally receive an update on water releases from Lake Cachuma and state legislative activities tied to the drought.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam at Lake Cachuma, will report on downstream water releases that benefit fish populations. While the biological opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries in 2000 details what the bureau must do to protect fish, especially the endangered Southern California Steelhead Trout, a new agreement is on the horizon. Ongoing dialogue between the bureau and the NMF is expected to culminate in a new biological opinion sometime in 2015.\u000a\u000aSupervisors will also receive a report from governmental advocates on legislative activity related to the state's perpetually dry conditions. The discussion will focus on negotiations over a water bond that voters will see on the statewide ballot and a pair of groundwater management bills that would emphasize sustainability.\u000a\u000aThe board will follow Tuesday's meeting with a broader discussion concerning water supplies and the drought at its Oct. 14 meeting.\u000a\u000aSupervisors must consider multiple parties when discussing Lake Cachuma and its holding. While the bureau operates the dam, the park surrounding Cachuma is run by the County Parks Division, with the County Water Agency charged with the Water Supply Contract. Meanwhile, the Cachuma Operations and Maintenance Board runs the infrastructure that delivers water to agencies around the county.\u000a\u000aThe Board of Supervisors will also receive a report from the Santa Barbara County Water Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey about current and future availability of water in the Cuyama Groundwater Basin. Over the past 50 years, water levels have dropped in parts of the basin by up to 400 feet.\u000a\u000aThe board meets at 9 a.m. in Santa Maria at the Betteravia Government Administration Building, 511 E. Lakeside Parkway.
